The association comprises 33 national professional bodies (Colegios Profesionales, Consejos Generales, Consejos Superiores) embracing over 1,000 local and regional bodies and close to one and a half million liberal professionals throughout the country. Unión Profesional ranges over the fields of law, healthcare, accountancy and finance, social care, science and technology. Its structure is inter-disciplinary. UP reflects the commitment of the professions to the reinforcement and advocacy of the culture and values of the professions in the wider community. UP is a key axis of intellectual, economic and social activity.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The association was created in 1980 for the furtherance and advocacy of the common interests of the professions and the coordinated attainment of public-interest aims. From its beginnings, UP has been a forum for debate, opinion and discussion on all issues relating to the professional bodies and their structures and the practice of the professions. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Unión Profesional plays an active international role. It is the vice chair of the World Union of the Professions (UMPL), a United Nations consultative body, and is a member of the Executive Committee of the European Council of the Liberal Professions (CEPLIS).&#xd;<br />The President of UP is Victoria Ortega, also the chair of the Consejo General de la Abogacía (the general council of the Spanish bar) and a member of the Consejo de Estado (the Spanish privy council).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />VISION&#xd;<br />Unión Profesional (UP) is the national association representing the regulated professional bodies of Spain.
