We have hundreds of thousands of supporters across the UK and elsewhere, but they are not members. Many, but not all, of them give money, others campaign, others pray or support us in other ways. The question does not allow for that possibility, which is the reason why we put '0' in the relevant box.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe countries listed above are those where we have programmes, but we support some regional partners and regional networks which have connections in other countries as well.","memberOrga":"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/aboutus/who/aims/sponsoring_churches/index.aspx","goal":"Poverty is an outrage against humanity. It robs people of dignity, freedom and hope, of power over their own lives. Christian Aid has a vision - an end to poverty - and we believe that vision can become a reality.&#xd;<br />The essential purpose of Christian Aid is to expose the scandal of poverty, to help in practical ways to root it out from the world and to challenge and change the systems which favour the rich and powerful over the poor and marginalised.&#xd;<br />Christian Aid works in some of the world's poorest communities in 37 countries wherever the need is greatest and regardless of religion, ethnicity or gender. It works with 475 partner organisations to eradicate poverty and injustice. By working through, and developing relationships with, local organisations (our partners) Christian Aid's work is rooted in the needs, views, aspirations, priorities and realities of poor and marginalised people. This partnership approach gives us insight into the local issues that perpetuate poverty. We are constantly working to strengthen our accountability to the poor and marginalised people with whom we work, for example by; ensuring that poor people and communities are involved in identifying what issues need to be addressed, and what needs to change; working to ensure that Christian Aid meets recognised standards in accountability and transparency, such as the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP) international standards and the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI).","acronym":"","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Taxation","euInitiatives":"Climate change&#xd;<br />Tax and illicit capital flight&#xd;<br />Refugees and Internally Displaced People (IDP's)&#xd;<br />Gender&#xd;<br />Some country- and region-specific processes, varying from time to time","lastUp":"2019-03-15T09:49:13.972+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
