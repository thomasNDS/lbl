In 2018, VERBUND achieved an annual turnover of 2.847,9  billion Euro with  2.784 employees. VERBUND covers all sectors of energy supply – from the production and transportation of electricity through international sales and marketing. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />More than four fifths of the electricity generation originates from climate friendly hydropower. VERBUND’s hydropower plants in Austria and Bavaria have a capacity of 7,700 megawatt (MW). The production portfolio is supplemented by wind power and thermal power plants.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />VERBUND, through its subsidiary Austrian Power Grid (APG), operates Austria's supra-regional high-voltage grid which extends over a distance of 3,500 km (route kilometres). This grid forms the backbone of Austria's electricity supply, enabling the supra-regional, domestic and international exchange of energy between producers and consumers and serves to ensure the stable provision of energy to the underlying distribution grids.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />VERBUND is also an active trader on the major European electricity markets. Electricity trading within the group forms the interface between generation, distribution and the wholesale market and can be seen as a central hub. Alongside the core business of electricity, VERBUND is also active in the field of environmental products with CO2 certificates and green certificates.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In terms of sales VERBUND is operating in the Austrian end-customer segment since July 2005. VERBUND serves approx. 403.000  private customers with climate-friendly electricity from 100% hydropower and approx. 66.000 customers with climate-neutral gas.
