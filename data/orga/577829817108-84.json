Everything we do is focused on satisfying the changing needs of our customers. We supply energy and energy-related services to over 25 million customer accounts in the UK, Ireland and North America, through strong brands such as British Gas, Bord Gáis and Direct Energy - supported by 12,000 engineers and technicians. &#xd;<br />We are developing new and innovative products and services for customers globally: &#xd;<br />- Our Connected Home business has developed products such as the Hive smart thermostat, plugs, sensors, lights and camera, which are now also available in Italy thanks to the partnership with Eni Gas&amp;Luce. &#xd;<br />- Through our Distributed Energy &amp; Power business we offer integrated energy solutions for commercial and industrial customers, including flexible generation, energy management systems, and battery storage. In the power sector, Centrica owns three gas-fired power stations in England and Wales. We also have a 20% interest in eight UK nuclear power stations. As part of our distributed generation activities, we acquired ENER-G Cogen in 2016, an established supplier and operator of combined heat and power (CHP) solutions. Moreover, in November 2017, we acquired REstore, the Europe’s leading demand response aggregator, managing a portfolio of industrial and commercial customers across Belgium, the UK, France and Germany.&#xd;<br />- Our Energy, Marketing &amp; Trading business operates in LNG trading, route-to-market, optimisation and risk-management for customers with decentralised generation assets. As part of this, Centrica plc acquired Neas Energy in 2016. Since then, we continue to expand our route-to-market offering across Europe and now serve customers who own decentralised assets with installed capacity of over 11,8 GW across a range of energy generation (of which 8.88 GW are renewable assets). &#xd;<br />- Exploration &amp; Production also continues to play an important role in our portfolio.
