Its membership comprises 81 organisations from 69 countries in Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe and the Americas. Through its members, IPA represents thousands of individual publishers around the world who service markets containing more than 5.6 billion people.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Based in Geneva, Switzerland, IPA represents the interests of the publishing industry in international fora and wherever publishers' interests are at stake.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />IPA was founded in 1896 in Paris by the leading publishers at the time. Its initial aim was to ensure that countries throughout the world showed respect for copyright, and properly implemented the (then) new international copyright treaty, the 'Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works'. And today, the promotion and defence of copyright is still one of IPA's main objectives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since its foundation, IPA also promotes and defends freedom to publish, a fundamental aspect of the human right to freedom of expression. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Likewise, IPA stands for the promotion of literacy and reading, and has always been a meeting place for publishers to network, exchange views and conduct business.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />IPA is an accredited non-governmental organisation (NGO) enjoying consultative relations with the United Nations.","acronym":"IPA","interests":"Business and Industry, Communication, Competition, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Enlargement, External Relations, International co-operation and development, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Copyright Review, including education&#xd;<br />DSM&#xd;<br />VAT on books&#xd;<br />Marrakesh Treaty implementation&#xd;<br />EU strategy at WIPO on Broadcasting Treaty and exceptions and limitations in education, libraries and archives","lastUp":"2019-07-02T12:55:11.944+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
