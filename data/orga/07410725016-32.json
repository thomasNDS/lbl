WAGGGS is a volunteer-led and volunteer involving organization that provides girls and young women with opportunities for self-development through non-formal education. The Europe Region WAGGGS is one of 5 regions of WAGGGS and provides over 1,3 million girls and young women in Europe with the opportunity to develop leadership and life skills, to become self-motivated, responsible and active participants of their local communities and at all levels of society.&#xd;<br />WAGGGS’ mission “to enable girls and young women to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world” aims to empower girls and young women, as active citizens and provide them opportunities to develop leadership and life skills through progressive self-development, challenge and adventure.&#xd;<br />The Europe Region WAGGGS serves 64 Girl Guiding/Scouting Associations in 41 countries in European Union (EU) states and non-EU member states such as Turkey, Georgia, and CIS countries as Armenia, Belarus, Russian Federation, Ukraine. WAGGGS’ Member Organizations (MOs) provide young people (aged 8 to 30) with opportunities to develop through non-formal education activities based on the values and method of Girl Guiding/Scouting and tailored to the needs of youth in their local and national cultures/environment.&#xd;<br />Girl Guiding/Scouting contributes to the learning and development of young people through non-formal educational programmes using a unique educational approach called the Girl Guide/Scout educational method. This method is based on values – such as commitment to helping others, personal and spiritual development – and non-formal education principles, and operates in an intergenerational, global, multi-cultural environment, thus encouraging the development of the whole person in her/his fullest potential as a responsible citizen by encompassing spiritual, moral, physical, mental, social, intellectual and emotional aspects.&#xd;<br />The Girl Guide/Scout educational method has five essential elements:&#xd;<br />1.Learning in small groups: learn to work effectively with others, support each other, negotiate and make democratic decisions, assert needs and opinions, and solve problems;&#xd;<br />2.Learning by doing: is at the hearth of non-formal education and empowers and motivate youth learning through real experiences, challenges, games, projects and experiments.&#xd;<br />3.Connecting with others: young people learn to trust, respect and connect with people of different ages, genders, cultural and social backgrounds;&#xd;<br />4.Connecting with the world: help young people to reflect on what it means to be a global citizen by undertaking community projects and speaking out on issues they care about;&#xd;<br />5.Personal development: value each individual learning style, encourage personal development and empower young people to self-direct their learning.&#xd;<br />The Girl Guiding/Scouting experience creates a safe environment where young people can develop skills, values, knowledge, behaviour and attitudes to take the lead at different levels. In particular, through Guiding they develop:&#xd;<br />- leadership skills (for example including but not limited to: integrity, autonomy, vision, organization and management, communication, coaching, facilitation, motivation, etc.)&#xd;<br />- self-confidence, self-esteem;&#xd;<br />- ability to cope with change;&#xd;<br />- appreciation of others;&#xd;<br />- personal responsibility;&#xd;<br />- commitment and skills in service to others;&#xd;<br />- healthy lifestyles;&#xd;<br />- intercultural understanding.&#xd;<br />In line with its mission and vision, WAGGGS primarily targets girls and young women from diverse backgrounds as to offer quality non-formal education opportunities to all. It also pays particular attention to working with both young women and men to identify and develop a gender-sensitive approach to leadership which can benefit all young people, their organisations and societies.","acronym":"EUROPE REGION WAGGGS","interests":"Borders and Security, Budget, Climate Action, Communication, Culture, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Public Health, Youth","euInitiatives":"- EU initiatives on the recognition of volunteering, youth rights, youth employment&#xd;<br />- European Solidarity Corps&#xd;<br />- Youth policies and Structured Dialogue on Youth Participation through the European Youth Forum&#xd;<br />- EU legislation on violence against women and on work-life balance through the European Women's Lobby&#xd;<br />- EU Policies on Gender Equality (including week of the girl)&#xd;<br />- Multi-financial Framework from Youth and Gender perspective&#xd;<br />- Eu elections 2019","lastUp":"2019-05-14T11:08:34.376+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
