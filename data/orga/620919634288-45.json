To achieve this goal, we use a two-approaches methodology: a project-based approach (by improving the well-being of migrants in concrete and immediate terms) and a comprehensive approach (by collecting data and building a database on violence against migrants and refugees).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />This methodology is divided into 4 phases:&#xd;<br />- the \"assessment and documentation\" phase, which consists of collecting data on violence in migration, setting up a database and disseminating this data in order to have the most complete mapping of this violence; &#xd;<br />- the \"specific actions and projects\" phase, which consists of supporting various field partners in their assessment work and in their projects aimed at concretely reducing violence against migrants; &#xd;<br />- the \"cross-cutting national policies\" phase, which consists of mobilizing relevant actors at the national level to effectively reduce all forms of violence against migrants;&#xd;<br />- the \"regulation\" phase, which consists of advocacy, at the international level, for better protection of migrants.","acronym":"EVAM","interests":"Borders and Security, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum","euInitiatives":"DG ECHO&#xd;<br />DG DEVCO&#xd;<br />DG HOME&#xd;<br />DG JUSTICE&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />External actions of the European Union&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Communication from the Commission - COM(2019) 126 final - Progress report on the Implementation of the European Agenda on Migration","lastUp":"2019-03-19T14:50:23.091+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
