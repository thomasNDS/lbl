We have agreed that the \"information to the consumer\" on risk and benefits of sunbed use could be further improved. ESA has recently made a proposal with 6 ideas on how to improve the EN60335-2-27 technical standard to that respect.    &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Together with CENELEC and the Austrian Standards Institute (ASI), ESA is now further implementing the EN16489-1 to 3 regarding the training of tanning facility staff and the provision of services by such facilities. Next to the UK we are now in the process of accreditation for training providers in The Netherlands (Oct. 2018). Austria and probably Hungary will come next. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- ESA is closely following the review of national legislation in several European countries regarding professional sun bed use.","lastUp":"2018-07-11T11:09:54.418+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
