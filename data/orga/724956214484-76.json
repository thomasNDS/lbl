These long-term investments provide a critical contribution to the real economy in Europe. &#xd;<br />Commercial property contributed EUR 385 billion to the EU economy in 2017, in fact, 2.8 % of total European economy, and directly employs 4 million people – more than the automotive, telecoms or banking sector.&#xd;<br />Property, both residential and commercial, is critical to achieving the EU’s sustainability targets. They offer huge energy-saving potential through investment of around EUR 60 billion per year – a major source of economic activity.&#xd;<br />Investment in new commercial property buildings and the refurbishment and development of existing buildings on average totals nearly EUR 257 billion each year – with infrastructure and housing, this represents 62% of all capital investment in the EU.","acronym":"EREF","interests":"Banking and financial services, Economy, finance and the euro, Environment, Taxation","euInitiatives":"The European Real Estate Forum has currently not published any positions on the main EU initiatives. However, every participating organisation has developed its own position papers on specific EU initiatives. &#xd;<br />The European Real Estate Forum meets 3-4 times a year to discuss and share information on some relevant EU policy initiative that may affect the real estate industry. We specifically discuss among other things:&#xd;<br />- Listed real estate investment policies (REITs regime)&#xd;<br />- Non-listed real estate investment policies (AIFMD Review, Solvency II 2020 Review, MIFID II, &#xd;<br />- Tax issues impacting real estate investment (ATAD II)&#xd;<br />- Sustainability regulation (Sustainable Finance Action Plan, Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We also discuss recent consultations on loan origination and advice on BASEL III","lastUp":"2020-01-08T11:26:01.884+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
