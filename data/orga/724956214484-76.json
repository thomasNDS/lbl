These long-term investments provide a critical contribution to the real economy in Europe. &#xd;<br />Commercial property contributed EUR 329 billion to the EU economy in 2015, in fact, 2.5% of total European economy, and directly employs 3.7 million people – more than the automotive, telecoms or banking sector.&#xd;<br />Property, both residential and commercial, is critical to achieving the EU’s sustainability targets. They offer huge energy-saving potential through investment of around EUR 60 billion per year – a major source of economic activity.&#xd;<br />Investment in new commercial property buildings and the refurbishment and development of existing buildings on average totals nearly EUR 252 billion each year – with infrastructure and housing, this represents 62% of all capital investment in the EU.","acronym":"EREF","interests":"Banking and financial services, Economy, finance and the euro, Environment","euInitiatives":"The European Real Estate Forum has currently not published any positions on the main EU initiatives.
