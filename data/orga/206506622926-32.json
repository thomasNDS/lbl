SLBC has always defended the evolution and the necessary reform of biology with the constant vocation to allow the biologist, pharmacist or physician, to retain its independence. Thus, the Union of clinical biology laboratories is actively committed to coherent grouping of biologists in order to pool resources and form a bulwark against the financialization of the profession. SLBC prepares the European competition and the economic consequences of the control of expenditure of biology, and wants to foster and promote a policy of quality, which is essential for the credibility of our profession, whose accreditation is the most accomplished form. Finally allow access to advanced technologies in our laboratories by the specialization of skills and the pooling of resources.","acronym":"SLBC","interests":"Public Health","euInitiatives":"Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications","lastUp":"2019-07-10T13:49:41.421+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
