Our mission is to remain one of the safest motorways in Europe and to achieve this, we invest a lot of time and effort in road safety, by ensuring that the motorway is well-maintained, that traffic is kept moving and that incidents that may occur on the motorway are quickly dealt with. &#xd;<br />In addition to our efforts on the road, we strongly believe that educated drivers make the difference in road safety, and hence, investing in educating people on road safety has become a major strategy for Attica Tollway. And as road safety education should start from a young age, to set a good basis for future behaviour, children and adolescents are targeted in most of the company's road education programs.","acronym":"AD","interests":"Climate Action, Environment, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"http://www.erscharter.eu/en","lastUp":"2018-01-17T08:43:50.541+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
