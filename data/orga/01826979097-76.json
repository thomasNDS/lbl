Bits of Freedom strives to influence legislation and self-regulation, on a national and a European level.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Freedom and privacy on the internet are under threat, with far-reaching consequences for the daily lives of millions of internet users. Their data are being collected ever more frequently and for an ever longer period. Their access to websites can be blocked. It is even being proposed to cut off users from the internet altogether. Meanwhile, the development of innovative services is also under threat.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The coming years will be decisive for the future of privacy and freedom on the internet. Now, we need to ensure that each internet user can decide for her- or himself what happens to their private data. Now, we have to act to make sure that each internet user can continue to enjoy an open and free internet without borders.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Bits of Freedom stands up for your freedom and privacy on the internet. We fight for an internet that is open for everyone, where everyone can continue sharing information, and where private communication remains private. Our strength is combining a broad range of expertise, a constructive lobby where possible, and sharp action where necessary.","acronym":"","interests":"Borders and Security, Competition, Consumers, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Foreign affairs and security policy, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and innovation, Single market, Trade","euInitiatives":"Bits of Freedom's main activities are related to privacy and control of personal data, government surveillance, copyright legislation, international trade agreements (when they affect digital human rights), cyber security, net neutrality, internet filters and data breaches.","lastUp":"2019-07-31T11:11:20.654+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
