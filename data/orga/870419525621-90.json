NTUA operates as a State University with nine Schools, self-administered by the Senate, the Rector, the Vice-Rectors, the School Presidents, representatives of the academic staff and students from every School, as well as representatives from other university bodies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The obvious need for any major institute of higher education to operate and offer education and research opportunities within a well organised and completely unambiguous internal system of principles, aims, procedures, rights and obligations, led, between the years 1997 and 2000, to the in depth internal and external evaluation of the NTUA’s structure and activities and consequently to the drawing up, discussion with all NTUA’s members and approval by the Senate and the Ministryof Education, (Government Gazette 1098/B/05.09.2000), of the NTUA Statute. This code of operation and development, considered as one of the best European University Statutes, defines that the main strategy of NTUA in the new millennium, is not only to maintain its position as an outstanding and internationally recognised public university of science and technology, but also to strengthen that position as regarding all its basic operations. All other strategies, aims and actions must be compatible with this basic strategic choice.","acronym":"NTUA","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Audiovisual and Media, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Culture, Development, Education, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Information Society, Internal Market, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Agriculture and Rural Development&#xd;<br />Communication&#xd;<br />Environment&#xd;<br />Energy&#xd;<br />Health and Food Safety&#xd;<br />Infrastructure and Logistics&#xd;<br />Maritime Affairs and Fisheries&#xd;<br />Mobility and Transport&#xd;<br />Regional and Urban Policy&#xd;<br />Structural Engineering &#xd;<br />Water Resources and Environment &#xd;<br />Geotechnical Engineering &#xd;<br />Nuclear Engineering  &#xd;<br />Industrial Management and Operational Research&#xd;<br />Electromagnetics, Electrooptics and Electronic Materials &#xd;<br />Information Transmission Systems and Material Technology &#xd;<br />Computer Science &#xd;<br />Communication, Electronic and Information Engineering &#xd;<br />Electric Power &#xd;<br />Industrial Electric Devices and Decision Systems&#xd;<br />Architectural Design &#xd;<br />Architectural Language, Communication and Design &#xd;<br />Chemical Sciences &#xd;<br />Materials Science and Engineering &#xd;<br />Synthesis and Development of Industrial Processes&#xd;<br />Topography &#xd;<br />Geography and Regional Planning &#xd;<br />Infrastructure and Rural Development&#xd;<br />Geological Sciences &#xd;<br />Mining Engineering &#xd;<br />Metallurgy and Materials Technology&#xd;<br />Ship Design and Maritime Transport &#xd;<br />Marine Engineering &#xd;<br />Physics &#xd;<br />Mathematics &#xd;<br />Mechanics &#xd;<br />Human Sciences, Social Sciences and Law","lastUp":"2018-01-31T08:04:51.544+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
