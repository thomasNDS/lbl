The object of research is the definition and implementation of a socio-cultural platform to make available digital databases of all the museums in Europe to all citizens, not only in order to access directly and universally to the catalogued assets, but also to use innovative digital tools (e.g. 3D-video simplified production) to tell stories associated with European culture. The digitized goods can be composed like pieces of a puzzle to build new, exciting stories about our past or live engaging experiences, associated with the history of European peoples.","lastUp":"2019-08-02T15:09:08.492+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
