PLATFORMA was officially launched on the occasion of the 2008 European Development Days in Strasbourg. The platform is co-financed by the Commission since 2009.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Coordinating the voice of European local and regional authorities with the European institutions, PLATFORMA has three major objectives: &#xd;<br />- increased political recognition of the activities of local and regional authorities in development cooperation;&#xd;<br />- in-depth dialogue between local and regional authorities and the European institutions in charge of development policies;&#xd;<br />- promotion of effective decentralised cooperation for the development of partner territories, especially in partnership with civil society.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Thirty-four partners gathered around this ambitious project. Since its creation, the PLATFORMA Secretariat is hosted by the Council of European Municipalities and Regions.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />CONTRIBUTING TO THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES IN PARTNER COUNTRIES&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Starting April 2012, PLATFORMA has a new grant from the European Commission and opened an office in Brussels, also hosted by the Council of European Municipalities and Regions. This grant finances the organisation of seminars in developing countries, with the purpose of gathering the recommendations of local and regional authorities in partner countries on the EU development cooperation policy.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Through the organisation of such events and through the active commitment of its partners, the platform hopes to render more dynamic the already existing links between local and regional authorities of the same continent. Moreover, the creation of an experts’ network from the North and from the South should allow to better match the needs of local and regional authorities in partner countries and the available expertise.  &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />The institutionalisation, at regional level, of a dialogue between local and regional authorities in partner countries and the European institutions is one of the results of the Structured Dialogue. The fact that PLATFORMA was entrusted with such a task shows the recognition of the work done by the network since 2009.","acronym":"PLATFORMA","interests":"Budget, Climate Action, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Regional Policy","euInitiatives":"Revision of the EU Consensus on Development: PLATFORMA is contributing to the definition of the new European Consensus on Development and interacts with the European Commission (EC), the European Parliament (EP) and the presidency of the Council of the European Union to maximise inclusion of a local perspective in the new consensus.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Review of Development Instruments: PLATFORMA engages in the EC-led reviews of several development instruments, in particular the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Development Fund (EDF). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Territorial Approach to Local Development: PLATFORMA increases the dialogue with the EUD for the operationalization of the Territorial Approach to Local Development (TALD) mechanism. Simultaneously an analysis is initiated to identify the accessibility in practice of EU funds for local governments. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EU-ACP future relations: PLATFORMA promotes the revision of the institutional and political framework for a better recognition of LRGs in development strategies. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development: PLATFORMA supports PCSD at all level: through advocacy toward the EU to effectively implement PCSD throughout its external and internal policies; and PLATFORMA encourages its partners and their broader networks to undertake PCSD at home.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Development Cooperation Awareness raising: PLATFORMA fosters and facilitates the involvement of LRGs in DEAR activities as LRGs are recognised as efficient players in raising awareness about global citizenship within EU citizens.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Migration, conflict and resilience: PLATFORMA calls on institutions to give local governments in partner countries a voice in the design, implementation and evaluation of the “compacts” between the European Union and their national governments and to promote city to city cooperation between Europe and partner countries as a key instrument for the implementation of the new approach.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Climate: PLATFORMA mobilises its network so as to build an evidence-based policy argument in favour of LRGs’ role and raise the profile of decentralised cooperation in UNFCCC COPs annual summits.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />United Nations Sustainable Development Goals localisation: PLATFORMA identifies ways to support partners to influence national governments’ uptake of LRG contributions to SDGs. PLATFORMA also participates in the Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments, creates visibility for and shares experiences of partners’ pilot initiatives to represent Europe’s towns and regions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />New Urban Agenda: PLATFORMA follows up the voluntary commitments and makes the links with the localisation of SDGs and their evaluation mechanisms and indicators, supports to disaggregated data collection and capitalising on the connections with the EU institutions that have been established during the preparation phase of the NUA: EC (DG REGIO and DG DEVCO), the EU Presidency and the EP (Urban Intergroup). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Equality &amp; Diversity: Along with the follow up on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment: Transforming the Lives of Girls and Women through EU External Relations (2016-2020) and the work on localisation of SDGs, PLATFORMA advocates for indicators that are both gender and geographically disaggregated in order to strengthen its calls for an increased role for women in local policies in developing countries. PLATFORMA promotes and disseminates the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Equality of Women and Men in Local Life.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />European Neighbourhood Policy: PLATFORMA follows up the eastern and southern neighbourhood policy and took part in the New European Neighbourhood Policy review. PLATFORMA coordinates Eastern neighbourhood LRGs contribution to the Eastern partnership (EaP) objectives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />All PLATFORMA policy positions are available on the following link: http://www.platforma-dev.eu/page.php?parent_id=3&amp;page_id=19","lastUp":"2018-09-19T17:53:02.496+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
