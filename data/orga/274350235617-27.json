December 2015 mandatory&#xd;<br />and quantified CO2 reduction targets by year 2020 (for emissions in Austria, this is a&#xd;<br />reduction from 16 percent to the year 2020 compared to 2005).&#xd;<br />( n)( n)F) For our next&#xd;<br />generation and in the general interest the period up to the year 2030, the EU is already&#xd;<br />proposing further targets (\"EU climate and energy Package 2030\"). &#xd;<br />These foresee an EU-wide&#xd;<br />reduction target of greenhouse gas emissions of at least 40 percent to 2030 compared&#xd;<br />to 1990.&#xd;<br />( n)( n)G) Public Consultation for Contributions to the Paris climate agreement from&#xd;<br />12. December 2015, because it is primarily the energy policy task to contribute&#xd;<br />economically with contributions against the greenhouse effect and climate change, following&#xd;<br />a few requests from citizens, from the European Parliament, and from certain EU Member&#xd;<br />States.&#xd;<br />( n)( n)H) Through efficient use of resources, the naturally occurring sustainable and&#xd;<br />regenerative energy carrier, there is again energy self-sufficiency of the company and for&#xd;<br />our next generations.&#xd;<br />( n)( n)I) Global warming and the associated greenhouse effect&#xd;<br />through the reciprocal swinging of the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere are long known.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The effects on global ocean and air currents and the declining nutrient content of crops for&#xd;<br />world food are certainty, but every person has an active and passive opportunity to&#xd;<br />contribute by preventing the progress of climate change.&#xd;<br />( n)( n)J) The entire natural&#xd;<br />resources are the basis of all operating and economic activities. But competitive&#xd;<br />disadvantages, which due to an inefficient use of this regenerable (inexhaustible) energy&#xd;<br />resource can arise also endanger or degenerate jobs of companies.&#xd;<br />( n)( n)K) Findings on&#xd;<br />the project, the investment analysis of the project, are in this project responsible for the&#xd;<br />environment and society is regulated in the general interest.&#xd;<br />( n)( n)L) The naturally&#xd;<br />occurring sustainable and regenerative energy sources for us are currently the solar energy,&#xd;<br />water energy and biogas energy with absolute exclusion of nuclear energy.&#xd;<br />( n)( n)M)&#xd;<br />Smaller hydropower plants are particularly ecological as well as the project of the small&#xd;<br />hydropower plant \"Ralserhof\", who, by their size, do not demand serious interference with&#xd;<br />nature, but especially with self-proclaimed conservationists, who are committed to any kind&#xd;<br />of renewable energy, Hydropower plants are controversial in contradiction.&#xd;<br />( n)( n)N) A few&#xd;<br />positive hydropower plants prove it repeatedly, that we put energy policy in symbiosis with&#xd;<br />environmental and climate protection together with economic resource consumption without&#xd;<br />taking greater risks, to still be responsible to the environment and society.&#xd;<br />( n)( n)O) If&#xd;<br />alternative energy sources are not researched and developed in the future will be through&#xd;<br />the shortage of fossil fuels result in an increase in price, which in turn has a more expensive&#xd;<br />effect on the natural resources of nature occurring energy carrier will pass.&#xd;<br />( n)( n)P) What&#xd;<br />sustainable and renewable sources of energy, also in economic terms in the optimal ratio&#xd;<br />used and earned economically.&#xd;<br />( n)( n)Q) From the feasibility comes efficient use of&#xd;<br />resources with this inexhaustible energy from the nature of producing the same production&#xd;<br />result the electric energy with less natural consumption (resources) is produced.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Energy","euInitiatives":"∫ = μ / σ( n)( n)The European Commission's plan is to finance sustainable growth.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />( n)( n) Energy Union and with Climate protection.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />( n)( n)Publication of information on organizations&#xd;<br />carrying out eligible activities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />( n)( n)( n)INH.
