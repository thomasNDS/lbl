EuDA members employ approximately 25,000 European employees directly “on land and on board of the vessels” and more than 48,300 people indirectly (through the suppliers and services companies). The combined fleet of EuDA’s members counts approximately 750 seaworthy EU-flagged vessels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Dredging activities are not well known by the larger public, but as a matter of fact, the European dredging companies, members of EuDA, are world market leaders with about 80% share of the worldwide open dredging market and a turnover of 9.2bn Euro in 2015. Although 70% of operations take place outside Europe, 90% of the returns flow back to Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Association serves its members in all kinds of requests related to dredging issues, presently strongly emphasising Social and Environmental affairs. These issues are coordinated by the Secretariat and executed by its specialised working groups composed of experts from the member companies. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Association will pursue its goals by endorsing policies to create fair and equitable conditions for competition; commits to respecting applicable national, European and international rules and regulations; commits to operating its fleet safely, effectively and responsibly.","acronym":"EuDA","interests":"Climate Action, Competition, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Humanitarian Aid, Internal Market, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Environment&#xd;<br />• Follow up on the Revised Waste Framework Directive, the Technical Report on assessment of hazardousness, position paper and organisation of European and national workshops to provide guidance on implementation of the Directive at national level;&#xd;<br />• Follow up on Ship Recycling issues and legislation;&#xd;<br />• Climate Change &amp; Air Emissions (position papers and statement on CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions MRV Regulation, consultation on Climate Change Adaptation; position paper and contribution to stakeholders consultations for sulphur emissions from ships, workshop and information paper on sulphur emissions reduction for dredgers);&#xd;<br />• Implementation of Habitats' Directive in Estuaries and in Rivers;&#xd;<br />• Marine Ecosystems and Environmental Impact Assessment (position paper on revision of EIA directive)&#xd;<br />• Ballast Water (IMO MEPC)&#xd;<br />• Marine Strategy (observer in Marine Strategy Navigation Group)&#xd;<br />• Maritime Spatial Planning - Intergrated Coastal Management - Ocean Governance&#xd;<br />Position paper, stakeholders’ hearings&#xd;<br />• PIANC Think Climate Coalition (member)&#xd;<br />• H2020 ThinkNature CSA (member)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Social&#xd;<br />• Follow up of ILO MLC implementation into national legislation (survey of implementation an issues for the dredgers)&#xd;<br />• Follow up of IMO HTW&#xd;<br />• Follow up of revision of Seafarers' directives&#xd;<br />• Directive Enforcement&#xd;<br />• State Aid to Maritime transport&#xd;<br />• Piracy (member of DG MOVE SAGMaS)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Transport&#xd;<br />• DG MOVE White Paper follow up of the maritime initiatives dealing with environment and social issues&#xd;<br />• A sustainable future for transport&#xd;<br />• Maritime Transport Strategy 2009-2018 (review)&#xd;<br />• Ports Policy, follow up on Regulation on Ports Services &#xd;<br />• TEN-T, Motorways of the Sea, Marco Polo, CEF&#xd;<br />• Member of the Steering Committee of the European Shipping Week 2015, 2017&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Markets&#xd;<br />• Level playing field and access to markets without barriers (DG MOVE, DG TRADE, DG GROW)&#xd;<br />• Support DG TRADE (Services) in CETA, TTIP and other FTA negotiations &#xd;<br />• Raising concerns over market access restrictions (e.g. India), closed markets (e.g. China) and closing of markets through 'tied financing'&#xd;<br />• successful coordination of diplomatic action (Benelux and DG TRADE) to repeal Indian decision on import duties on dredgers and their spare parts;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Maritime Policy&#xd;<br />• Maritime Spatial Planning (DG MARE) Contribution to Study, hearings and consultations, presentation at the high level conference, position paper and follow up on MSP directive;&#xd;<br />• European Maritime Day (participation and interventions in Rome 2009, Gijon 2010, Gdansk 2011 “The European Dredging Industry’s People make its Maritime Success”; Göteborg 2012; La Valette 2013; Bremen 2014; Athens 2015 \"Working with nature: innovative solutions for jobs and growth in coastal areas\"); Turku 2016&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />R&amp;D&#xd;<br />• Research and FP7 (input for calls)&#xd;<br />• Presentations on Nature-Based Solutions (Building with Nature)&#xd;<br />• Horizon 2020 (ThinkNature CSA, member of the consortium)&#xd;<br />• ETP WATERBORNE, WATERBORNE Declaration&#xd;<br />• Reviewer for TRA2012, TRA2014 and TRA2016&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />INTERREG&#xd;<br />• Beachmed (I-II-III)&#xd;<br />• Coastal Protection","lastUp":"2017-02-07T11:09:08.450+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
