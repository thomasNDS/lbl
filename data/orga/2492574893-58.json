EuDA members employ approximately 25,000 European employees directly “on land and on board of the vessels” and more than 48,300 people indirectly (through the suppliers and services companies). The combined fleet of EuDA’s members counts approximately 750 seaworthy EU-flagged vessels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Dredging activities are not well known by the larger public, but as a matter of fact, the European dredging companies, members of EuDA, are world market leaders with about 80% share of the worldwide open dredging market and a turnover of 8.6bn Euro in 2018. Although 70% of operations take place outside Europe, 90% of the returns flow back to Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Association serves its members in all kinds of requests related to dredging issues, presently strongly emphasising Social and Environmental affairs. These issues are coordinated by the Secretariat and executed by its specialised working groups composed of experts from the member companies. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Association will pursue its goals by endorsing policies to create fair and equitable conditions for competition; commits to respecting applicable national, European and international rules and regulations; commits to operating its fleet safely, effectively and responsibly.","acronym":"EuDA","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Customs, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Environment&#xd;<br />• Follow up on the Green Deal &#xd;<br />• Climate Change &amp; Air Emissions (position papers and statement on CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions MRV Regulation, consultation on Climate Change Adaptation; position paper and contribution to stakeholders consultations for sulphur emissions from ships, workshop and information paper on sulphur emissions reduction for dredgers);&#xd;<br />• Follow up on the Revised Waste Framework Directive, the Technical Report on assessment of hazardousness, position paper and organisation of European and national workshops to provide guidance on implementation of the Directive at national level;• Implementation of Habitats' Directive in Estuaries and in Rivers;&#xd;<br />• Marine Ecosystems and Environmental Impact Assessment (position paper on revision of EIA directive)&#xd;<br />• Ballast Water (IMO MEPC) policy paper&#xd;<br />• Marine Strategy (observer in Marine Strategy Navigation Group)&#xd;<br />• Maritime Spatial Planning - Intergrated Coastal Management - Ocean Governance&#xd;<br />Position paper, stakeholders’ hearings&#xd;<br />• PIANC Think Climate Coalition (member)&#xd;<br />• H2020 ThinkNature CSA (consortium partner)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Social&#xd;<br />• Follow up of ILO MLC implementation into national legislation (survey of implementation an issues for the dredgers)&#xd;<br />• Follow up of IMO HTW&#xd;<br />• Follow up of revision of Seafarers' directives&#xd;<br />• Follow up of Schengen Visas&#xd;<br />• State Aid to Maritime transport&#xd;<br />• Piracy (member of DG MOVE SAGMaS)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Transport&#xd;<br />• A sustainable future for transport&#xd;<br />• DG MOVE Maritime Transport Strategy 2009-2018 (review)&#xd;<br />• Ports Policy, follow up on Regulation on Ports Services &#xd;<br />• TEN-T, Motorways of the Sea, Marco Polo, CEF&#xd;<br />• Member of the Steering Committee of the European Shipping Week 2015, 2017&#xd;<br />• Member of the ESSF Plenary&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Tax&#xd;<br />• support on the revision of the directive on taxation of bunkering fuels&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Markets&#xd;<br />• Level playing field and access to markets without barriers (DG MOVE, DG TRADE, DG GROW, DG COMP)&#xd;<br />• Support DG TRADE (Services) in FTA negotiations &#xd;<br />• Follow-up of implementation of CETA and other FTA negotiations &#xd;<br />• Raising concerns over market access restrictions (e.g. India), closed markets (e.g. China) and closing of markets through 'tied financing schemes'&#xd;<br />• successful coordination of diplomatic action (Benelux and DG TRADE) to repeal Indian decision on import duties on dredgers and their spare parts;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Maritime Policy&#xd;<br />• Maritime Spatial Planning (DG MARE) Contribution to Study, hearings and consultations, presentation at the high level conference, position paper and follow up on MSP directive;&#xd;<br />• European Maritime Day (participation and interventions in Rome 2009, Gijon 2010, Gdansk 2011 “The European Dredging Industry’s People make its Maritime Success”; Göteborg 2012; La Valette 2013; Bremen 2014; Athens 2015 \"Working with nature: innovative solutions for jobs and growth in coastal areas\"); Turku 2016;Poole (2017) and Burgas (2018). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />R&amp;D&#xd;<br />• Presentations on Nature-Based Solutions (Building with Nature)&#xd;<br />• Horizon 2020 (ThinkNature CSA, consortium partner)&#xd;<br />• ETP WATERBORNE, WATERBORNE Declaration&#xd;<br />• Reviewer and participant to TRA2012, TRA2014, TRA2016 and TRA2018&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />INTERREG&#xd;<br />• Beachmed (I-II-III)&#xd;<br />• Coastal Protection","lastUp":"2020-01-07T11:51:07.695+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
