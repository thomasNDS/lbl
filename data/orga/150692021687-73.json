Our DNA demonstrates the ambition to intervene in Portuguese society through a proactive participation in the defence of sustainability values, because we understand that only through the balance between environment, society and economy will it be possible to build a more cohesive, social and economic world, in full respect for the natural limits of the planet. ZERO's intervention is based on solid ideas and a permanent dialogue with the different key players to achieve goals such as:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ZERO fossil fuels &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ZERO pollution&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ZERO waste of resources&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ZERO destruction of ecosystems and biodiversity&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ZERO social and economic inequality","acronym":"ZERO","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Climate Action, Consumers, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"ZERO follows the policies, initiatives and legislative files in several areas, highlighting energy (Clean Energy Package), climate change (2030 and 2050 targets, ETS, ESR), noise/air quality, circular economy, chemicals, waste and transport (CO2 emissions, taxation, e-mobility, fossil vs. clean fuels).","lastUp":"2019-09-11T14:16:28.655+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
