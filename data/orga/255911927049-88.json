All sharing a common goal and vision; promoting open standards for energy demand side management, smart grid and smart metering systems.The energy industry is facing countless new challenges. Most issues revolve around the 'energy trilemma' meaning the sector is striving to ensure that energy is secure, sustainable and affordable. The critical issue is about enabling the smart grid, an energy infrastructure that runs from generation to distribution and includes thousands of grid-connected devices and systems that consume energy. A global revolution on interoperability standards is needed to guarantee innovation in terms of adopting new technologies and open standards as they come available. That's where the OSGP Protocol stands out!&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our vision is a strong participation of key industry stakeholders working together to realize the next generation smart grid leading towards the long-term goals of the smart grid: affordability, security and sustainability.","acronym":"OSGP","interests":"Energy","euInitiatives":"Alle activiteiten op gebied van energy (clean energy, Energy directive, Winterpackage, smart grids/metering, etc), en met name standaarden.
