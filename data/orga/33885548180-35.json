In order to safeguard the rights enjoyed by dealers under this Regulation, which expired in May 2013, CECRA has been trying to reach an agreement with vehicle manufacturers concerning a voluntary code of conduct.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Furthermore, over the last couple of years, CECRA worked closely with a range of stakeholders, including vehicle manufacturers and various national and European standardisation bodies in order to ensure that both independent and authorised repairers enjoy standardised access to the information they need to do their job.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As the sole representative of car dealers and repairers at European level, CECRA was part of GEAR 2030, a High Level group created by the Commission to ensure the competitiveness and sustainability of the automotive industry in Europe.","lastUp":"2019-10-03T11:42:46.320+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
