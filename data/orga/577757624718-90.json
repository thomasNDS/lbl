Our goal is to help people invest better, retire better and create a better society for all.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We have been in business since 1983, initially managing the assets of our owner, the BT Pension Scheme. More recently we have been growing the proportion of third party customers, drawn from institutions to advised private investors. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />With £33.51 billion in assets&#xd;<br />under management, we focus on holistic returns – outcomes for our clients that go beyond&#xd;<br />the financial – and consider the impact our decisions have on society, the environment and the&#xd;<br />wider world. Our stewardship team, Hermes EOS, is one of the world’s leading engagement&#xd;<br />resources, advising on £389 billion on behalf of over 40 international institutional investors.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We concentrate on areas where our expertise can add most value for our investors, whether through specialist skills or accessing unique investment opportunities. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our public markets capabilities include high active share equities, specialist credit and multi asset. Our private markets expertise includes real estate, infrastructure, private equity and private debt.","acronym":"Hermes Investment Ma","interests":"Banking and financial services, Climate Action, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Transport","euInitiatives":"As part of our responsibility philosophy, we are not content to simply follow investment orthodoxies but instead look to highlight and constructively challenge areas where we believe we in the industry are failing in order to improve the contribution of the financial services industry to society. We do this because we believe that we in the finance industry are in a privileged position, but importantly, one in which we are acting as fiduciaries on behalf of others. As such it is incumbent upon to us ensure that the system in which we operate is working on behalf of those whom we serve. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our public policy and sector engagement is done both directly and through active contribution to sector organisations, such as&#xd;<br />300 Club, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, UNEP Finance Initiative.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EU initiatives, policies and legislative files currently followed are:&#xd;<br />Capital Markets Union&#xd;<br />High Level expert Group on Sustainable Finance&#xd;<br />Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP) directive&#xd;<br />EU Fund For Strategic Investments (EFSI)&#xd;<br />Energy Union&#xd;<br />Renewable Energy&#xd;<br />Energy Efficiency &amp; Green Buildings : EU EPBD, EU EED, Smart Finance for Smart Buildings, EE package&#xd;<br />Energy Efficiency Finance Institutions Group&#xd;<br />Emission Trading Scheme&#xd;<br />Transport&#xd;<br />Non Financial Disclosure Directive","lastUp":"2019-04-09T18:26:14.785+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
