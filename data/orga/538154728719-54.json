HyER’s aim is to become the European point of reference for hydrogen and electro mobility in EU regions, cooperating with key decision-members at the EU level and assisting members effectively to develop their hydrogen and electro mobility activities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The association was created in 2006 and now represents 16 regions in 10 countries over Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />HyER supports the deployment and commercialisation of battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles. We assist our members in the development of their hydrogen and electro mobility activities by enabling the share of knowledge and capacity for decision making.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />With all its activities, HyER wishes to help the European Union to reach its emission reduction targets, as well as contribute to the development of a low carbon economy in Europe. A sustainable EU transport and energy system will also help provide a higher quality of life to all EU citizens. For all this, cooperation between European regions and cities is necessary, in order to share knowledge and know-how.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Electro-mobility as understood by the European Commission encompasses both fuel cell and battery electric vehicles.","acronym":"HyER","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"HyER is closely following the development of EU policies in the field of transport and energy. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />HyER is currently following the developments of the Clean Bus Initiative from the Commissioner for Transport. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />HyER currently takes part in the FCH-JU’s Regional Initiative which involves over 80 Cities and Regions.
