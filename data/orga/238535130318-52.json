Thus, the GDN has routinely sought to initiate conversations with various Directorates-General of the European Commission, foremost with - in alphabetical order -the DGs CONNECT; Digital Single Market; Education and Culture; Employment; and Justice. Several spokespersons of these DGs have  attended GDN meetings and contributed to the conference programme by submitting video messages and interventions. This way the GDN systematically  provided several D.G.s with an overarching view that transcended sectoral policies. To the GDN, educational data accompany a citizen not just within the education sector but remain relevant during a person's professional career. The issues that matter the most here are listed in the Groningen Declaration itself: Ownership of data;privacy; authentication; interoperability; and recognition. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Many of these same issues are now being addressed in new EU policies, amongst which:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- the Digital Education Agenda&#xd;<br />- Erasmus+ after 2020&#xd;<br />- the European Education Area 2025&#xd;<br />- the Sorbonne Process&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Building on seven years of outreach and dialogue with the Commission, the GDN continues its efforts to influence the design of Erasmus+ after 2020, in order to ensure that the programme promotes the digital portability of student data (learning agreements, transcript of records and other credentitials) in line with the principles laid down in the 2012 Groningen Declaration.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />For these purposes, we write position papers, take the floor at EU events, invite EU officials to speak at our events, visit officials in their offices to discuss policy and practice.","lastUp":"2018-10-18T14:10:23.065+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
