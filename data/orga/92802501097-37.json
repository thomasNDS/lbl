Today ECMA represents the major cigar manufacturers in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain (including the Canary Islands) and Switzerland. Together the ECMA members account for over 90% of the cigars produced in and exported from the European Union. With a total number of approximately 9.4 billion cigars being consumed within the European Union each year, cigar consumption represents approximately 1,6% of the total consumption of tobacco products (cigarettes, smoking tobacco and cigars) in the European Union. This makes the cigar industry the smallest member of the tobacco family.","acronym":"ECMA","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Consumers, Customs, Employment and Social Affairs, Institutional affairs, Public Health, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"DIRECTIVE 2014/40/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 3 April 2014 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products and repealing Directive 2001/37/EC&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Establishment of Implementing and Delegated Acts necessary to apply Directive 2014/40/EU&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2011/64/EU of 21 June 2011 on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured Tobacco&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008&#xd;<br />concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC","lastUp":"2019-07-12T14:28:52.601+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
