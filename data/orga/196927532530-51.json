December 2015 mandatory and quantified CO2 reduction targets by year 2020 (for emissions in Austria, this is a reduction from 16 percent to the year 2020 compared to 2005).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />C) For the period up to the year 2030, the EU is already proposing further targets (\"EU climate and energy Package 2030\"). These foresee an EU-wide reduction target of greenhouse gas emissions of at least 40 percent to 2030 compared to 1990.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />D) Public Consultation for Contributions to the Paris climate agreement from 12. December 2015, because it is primarily the energy policy task to contribute economically with contributions against the greenhouse effect and climate change, following a few requests from citizens, from the European Parliament, and from certain EU Member States.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />E) Through efficient use of resources, the naturally occurring sustainable and regenerative energy carrier, there is again energy self-sufficiency of the company.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />F) Global warming and the associated greenhouse effect through the reciprocal swinging of the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere are long known. The effects on global ocean and air currents and the declining nutrient content of crops for world food are certainty, but every person has an active and passive opportunity to contribute by preventing the progress of climate change.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />G) The entire natural resources are the basis of all operating and economic activities. But competitive disadvantages, which due to an inefficient use of this regenerable (inexhaustible) energy resource can arise also endanger or degenerate jobs of companies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />H) Findings on the project, the investment analysis of the project, are in this project responsible for the environment and society is regulated in the general interest.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />I) The naturally occurring sustainable and regenerative energy sources for us are currently the solar energy, water energy and biogas energy with absolute exclusion of nuclear energy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />J) Smaller hydropower plants are particularly ecological as well as the project of the small hydropower plant \"Ralserhof\", who, by their size, do not demand serious interference with nature, but especially with self-proclaimed conservationists, who are committed to any kind of renewable energy, Hydropower plants are controversial in contradiction.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />K) A few positive hydropower plants prove it repeatedly, that we put energy policy in symbiosis with environmental and climate protection together with economic resource consumption without taking greater risks, to still be responsible to the environment and society.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />L) If alternative energy sources are not researched and developed in the future will be through the shortage of fossil fuels result in an increase in price, which in turn has a more expensive effect on the natural resources of nature occurring energy carrier will pass.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />M) What sustainable and renewable sources of energy, also in economic terms in the optimal ratio used and earned economically.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />N) From the feasibility comes efficient use of resources with this inexhaustible energy from the nature of producing the same production result the electric energy with less natural consumption (resources) is produced.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />O) Thus, a reduction of resource consumption is off non-renewable energy sources compared to these renewable ones given to energy carriers and brings the society through the efficient value creation a wealth to the general advantage.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />“Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness” &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Ralser Alois- Private Company","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture, Climate Action, Energy","euInitiatives":".&#xd;<br />π&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />A)\tEU- contributions to public consultation of the European Parliament are actions which in turn require a public registration in the EU- transparency database (EU- register).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />B)\tAs an own contribution for specific activities falling within the scope of the register to the nationally determined contribution (NDC) on the naturally occurring sustainable and regenerative energy sources, following a few requests from citizens, from the European Parliament, and from certain EU Member States.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />C)\tThe naturally occurring sustainable and regenerative energy sources for us are currently solar energy, water energy and biogas energy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />D)\tAs with all renewable energy sources, no pollutants and greenhouse gases are directly released in the use of this renewable, sustainable source of energy and are thus in the long-term, public and in the national economic interest essential part of environmental and climate protection.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />E)\tGlobal warming and the associated greenhouse effect through the reciprocal swinging of the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere are long known.
