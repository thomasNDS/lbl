For around 130 years, we have continuously created value over the long term by assuming a wide diversity of risks globally. We are convinced that this business concept can be successfully projected into the future only through sustainable action. By this we understand the need to balance economic, ecological and social requirements. To this end, we actively involve our local and global stakeholders, above all our investors, clients and employees&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />“Turning risk into value” – this is the Munich Re maxim we have anchored in our mission statement. We are committed to our corporate responsibility towards our stakeholders. To honour this commitment, we have made responsible action – corporate responsibility – part and parcel of our strategy and have firmly embedded it in our organisation. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Munich Re’s guiding principle is to create sustainable value and conduct its affairs in a responsible manner. We are fully convinced that only by taking this holistic approach can we secure the long-term success of our integrated business model. It is in particular to our clients and investors that we guarantee continuous value creation, in giving full consideration to ecological and social aspects in the interests of our staff and for the benefit of society as a whole. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our hallmarks are innovation, solidity and client focus.
