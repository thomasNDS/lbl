Over the years we have been developing new services in the education, intercultural dialogue, social cohesion and work inclusion, through a constant networking with citizens, associations and public bodies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our objective is supporting the inclusion of disadvantage and not self-sufficient people through tailor-made paths aimed to promote self-reliance among the beneficiaries. We do this with our non renounceable values, such as respect for person, social responsibility, participation and transparency. We put our passion and professionalism at the service of institutions and public or private bodies to offer the maximum degree of adaptability in services we develop.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Thanks to an expert and young team of more than 250 people with specific know-how and a strong stakeholder network (at today, we subscribed 39 protocols/conventions with public and private entities), Camelot provides high-quality professional services and innovation through a constant research for best practices.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />A multi-stakeholder approach is considered an essential tool for people's empowerment and development, to enhance the quality of the provided services. Therefore, we continuously work to extend our network with private and public bodies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Camelot is UNI EN ISO 9001:2008 certified for project design and social services providing (pre-school age educative, extra scholastic and scholastic integration services).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2011, Camelot started European project design activity and the Cooperative won his first European tender under EIF Fund (European Integration Fund) for social mediation and intercultural dialogue.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />In 2014, we opened Bologna offices in order to manage SPRAR project with young or unaccompanied migrants and Pilastro2016 social and urban requalification project. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2015, Camelot received a positive result (two starts out of three) in Legality Rating from the Italian Antitrust Authority (AGCOM). From the same year, we coordinate the first regional hosting Hub for young and unaccompanied asylum seekers, financed by the AMIF (Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2016, we activated in Bologna the social innovation project Vesta, a web platform which allows citizens to host refugees in their families.","acronym":"Coop.
