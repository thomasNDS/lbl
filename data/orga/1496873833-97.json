CECCM serves as an off-competition platform for exchanging views and discussing proposed regulations which enables its members to define balanced common positions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CECCM establishes pro-active co-operation with other pan-European tobacco manufacturers’ associations and where appropriate presents joint positions to regulators. As a result, CECCM is well placed to contribute constructively to the definition of tobacco related regulations.","acronym":"CECCM","interests":"Agriculture, Business and Industry, Consumers, Customs, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, General and Institutional Affairs, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"Issues of interest in 2016/2017:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tWorks of the EP Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Budgetary Control Committee, and Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.  &#xd;<br />•\tTransposition and implementation of Directive 2014/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States  concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products and repealing Directive 2001/37/EC. &#xd;<br />•\tPreparatory work with regard to the outstanding secondary legislation (Implementing and delegated acts) derived from Directive 2014/40/EU with special focus on Ingredient and additives regulations and Tracking and Tracing of tobacco products. &#xd;<br />•\tPreparatory work regarding the review of the Council Directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise taxes applied to tobacco products. &#xd;<br />•\tPreparatory work regarding the review of Council Directive 2008/118/EC on the general arrangements for excise duty (repealing Directive 92/12/EEC) &#xd;<br />•\tImplementation of the Commission Regulation (EC) No 684/2009 of 24 July 2009 implementing Council Directive 2008/118/EC as regards the computerised procedures for the movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty.&#xd;<br />•\tImplementation of Decision 1152/2003/EC on computerising the movement and surveillance of excisable products&#xd;<br />•\tCommunity Custom Code and its implementing regulations.&#xd;<br />•\tBilateral International Trade Agreements and TTIP.&#xd;<br />•\tCECCM submissions to the TRIS notifications regarding national legislation implementing plain/standardised packaging for tobacco products.   &#xd;<br />•\tPublic consultations on the transparency register.&#xd;<br />•\tAnalysis of the outcomes of the WHO  FCTC CoP 7.","lastUp":"2018-05-22T09:38:18.053+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"600000-699999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
