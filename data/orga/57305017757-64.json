Full details here: https://cdt.org/financials/","goal":"The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) is a non-profit public policy organization dedicated to promoting the democratic potential of the Internet.  We were founded in 1994.  Our main office is in Washington, DC, USA.  Our mission is to conceptualize, develop, and implement public policies that will keep the Internet open, innovative and free.  Our main issues are consumer privacy (including privacy of electronic health records), free expression, security and surveillance (including cybercrime and cybersecurity), Internet openness, and intellectual property.  Our goals include adoption of comprehensive baseline standards for consumer privacy, robust protection of online free expression, the establishment of reasonable limits on government surveillance, and the protection of Internet intermediaries from liability for the conduct of their users.  We seek to promote dialogue and consensus-building among stakeholders, with the aim of developing balanced solutions to the policy challenges of the Information Society.  We conduct research and produce reports on policy issues affecting the Internet, contribute to the development of technical standards, promote the adoption of industry best practices that will empower consumers, and participate in government policymaking processes.  Globally, we collaborate with Internet policy activists working to protect and enhance human rights.","acronym":"CDT","interests":"Borders and Security, Communication, Consumers, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Single market, Trade","euInitiatives":"DSM Copyright Directive: CDT has engaged with MEPs on free expression and intermediary liability issues. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Terrorist Content Online Regulation: CDT has written several blogposts and held meetings with MEPs on this Regulation, focused on free expression  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />E-Evidence Regulation and Directive: CDT has written several papers on these pieces of draft legislation. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />E-Privacy Regulation: CDT submitted two analyses and blogposts for the attention of Members of the European Parliament.","lastUp":"2019-03-31T20:30:38.671+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"400000-499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
