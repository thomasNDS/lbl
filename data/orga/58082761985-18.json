Ordinary membership is open to international and wholesale insurance and reinsurance companies that hold a license from their domiciliary regulator to transact such business. In practice, most Ordinary members tend to operate in or through London. &#xd;\n&#xd;\nAssociate – open to insurance and reinsurance companies outside London. Associate members may attend the association’s annual general meeting, but have no voting rights. They receive a basic publication service. &#xd;\n&#xd;\nAffiliate – introduced in January 2003 to cater for London market organisations who are either in run-off or who provide professional services to the association’s Ordinary members. Affiliate membership confers no voting rights but offers the benefit of the IUA’s information services. Affiliate members may also, where appropriate, take part in the IUA’s committee activity.","goal":"The IUA exists to promote and enhance the business environment for international insurance and reinsurance companies operating in or through London.","acronym":"IUA","interests":"Banking and financial services, Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Application of Solvency II&#xd;<br />Equivalence of insurance jurisdictions&#xd;<br />EU/US insurance dialogue&#xd;<br />Insurance Distribution Directive&#xd;<br />General Data Protection Regulation&#xd;<br />Trade talks affecting insurance and reinsurance&#xd;<br />Environmental Liability Directive&#xd;<br />Systemically important financial institutions and resolution&#xd;<br />'Brexit' implementation&#xd;<br />Cyber Insurance and risk&#xd;<br />Sustanability Risks&#xd;<br />Big Data&#xd;<br />Cyber Security&#xd;<br />Motor Insurance Directive&#xd;<br />IFRS17&#xd;<br />Liability developments including insurance&#xd;<br />General Insurance Stress Testing&#xd;<br />Environmental, Societal and Governance matters&#xd;<br />Conduct Risk&#xd;<br />Insurance Guarantee Schemes&#xd;<br />Trade agreements that include financial services&#xd;<br />Corporate Governance","lastUp":"2019-09-12T11:46:14.653+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
