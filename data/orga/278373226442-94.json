Batteries will enable the transition. The auto industry alone will need batteries in huge numbers to replace fossil fuels with electricity. The ability to store energy is also crucial to free the world’s energy generation and distribution from coal, oil and natural gas. Northvolt accelerates this transition by building Europe’s largest battery factory.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Northvolt is building the next generation battery factory and our plan for Europe’s largest battery factory includes a new concept inspired by the semiconductor industry, focusing on: scale, customized customer solutions, vertical integration and highly controlled manufacturing. The execution is fundamentally different compared to other battery production units. Northvolt have a solid business plan in place that enables us to produce high quality batteries at an affordable cost, at a time where the market window is open.","acronym":"","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Customs, Energy, Environment, Transport","euInitiatives":"Energy Union and Climate&#xd;<br />Making energy more secure, affordable and sustainable&#xd;<br />Sustainable Batteries&#xd;<br />Battery Directive&#xd;<br />Sustainable sourcing of raw materials&#xd;<br />Renewable energy driective&#xd;<br />Circular economy directive&#xd;<br />Industrial policy&#xd;<br />Important Projects of Common European Interest","lastUp":"2020-01-07T14:18:59.620+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
