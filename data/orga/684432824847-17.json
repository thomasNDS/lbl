It encompasses more than 95% of the pharmaceutical industry operating in Greece. Its 65 member companies – 27 Greek and 38 multinationals – are constantly investing in the development of effective medicines and treatments with a view to safeguarding the right of all citizens to health and better quality of life.&#xd;<br />SFEE was established in 1982 and for more than 30 years now has championed the common interests of patients, pharmaceutical companies and their workforce. Since 1983, SFEE has been a member of EFPIA (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations), which is the voice of the pharmaceutical industry at the European Union level. EFPIA represents 34 associations of pharmaceutical companies in the EU Member States and 1,900 companies committed to researching, developing and bringing to patients new medicines that improve health and quality of life around the world.&#xd;<br />With a high sense of responsibility towards Greek society, we act in the service of the common interests of the citizens, the State and the pharmaceutical companies. Our vision and mission are reflected in the formulation and support of principled and well-founded views that can crucially contribute to promoting public health and patients’ access to innovative and generic medicines. Compliance with the new, strict ethical rules is a fundamental requirement for all our member companies.&#xd;<br />Pharmaceutical companies worldwide, and of course in Greece, play a pivotal role and make an undeniable contribution in the effort to achieve a high level of public health and thereby create conditions for economic growth and social progress.&#xd;<br />The world pharmaceutical industry is one of the most dynamic, but also most sensitive, sectors of the global economy. The new medicines and revolutionary treatments are developed in the laboratories of pharmaceutical companies across the globe. We work systematically to maintain and strengthen the momentum of the ongoing pharmaceutical revolution and enhance mankind’s arsenal in the fight against diseases.","acronym":"SFEE","interests":"Banking and financial services, Budget, Competition, Consumers, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, External Relations, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"- EC proposal on HTA&#xd;<br />- IP/SPC manufacturing waiver&#xd;<br />- European Presidencies&#xd;<br />- Patients Access to healthcare&#xd;<br />- Cross-country collaborations&#xd;<br />- BREXIT&#xd;<br />- European Semester","lastUp":"2019-12-04T11:42:46.896+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
