A number of changes have been adopted in relation to their role, functions and composition of their membership (i.e. from 2/3 to 60:40).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The principal aim of the NWWAC is to bring together stakeholders from across Europe to advise the Commission (whether by own initiative proposals or as a result of open public consultations) on matters of fisheries management in respect of the North Western Waters - ICES areas Vb (EC waters), VI, VII.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />NWWAC members are composed of fishing industry, other fishing interests (processors, auctions, consumers...)and other groups of interest representatives such as environmental NGOs or anglers.
