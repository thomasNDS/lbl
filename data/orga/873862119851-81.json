They were united by an ambition to mend relations between European horticulturists, to rebuild burnt bridges. That vision inspired them to form the Association Internationale des Producteurs de l’Horticulture (AIPH), laying the foundations for an international community that exists to this day.&#xd;<br />AIPH is serving the diverse needs of growers in a globalised world. Pushing the boundaries of science and sharing cutting edge research. To make clear the value of plants in the urban setting, and to advance the essential role they play in sustaining our planet. &#xd;<br />Our mission is: to reignite and uphold an appreciation of plants that we believe is a basic human instinct. As an organisation we strive for a world in which humanity, technology and nature exist in healthy and stable equilibrium. &#xd;<br />We support and promote the work of our members – the grower organisations around the world who together form our proud AIPH community. Through the expertise and energy they give to horticulture, they embody everything that we stand for.&#xd;<br />Globally we act as the central source of industry information. Our statistical yearbook gives an unrivalled view of industry trends and developments, valued by our community and all who take interest in our rapidly moving sector. We bring members together both physically and digitally, and encourage the sharing of new ideas and techniques so that horticulture never stands still.&#xd;<br />We advocate fair and robust plant breeders’ rights, encouraging innovation and rewarding quality so that growers too can reap the benefits of their work. We promote the most sustainable, ethical and advanced practices in ornamental plant production.&#xd;<br />Our Green City initiative promotes the essential role of plants in creating vibrant urban areas in which people and businesses can thrive. Our environment, human wellbeing, social cohesion and economies are all improved by intelligently designed green space.&#xd;<br />Finally, AIPH is responsible for the world’s finest horticultural expositions. Upholding the very highest standards, we ensure that approved exhibitions benefit growers and visitors alike by inspiring greater appreciation of ornamental plants. &#xd;<br />We aim to put flower, plant and landscaping services on a global agenda, with a vision to:&#xd;<br />1.Stimulate increased demand for ornamental trees, plants and flowers worldwide.&#xd;<br />2.Protect and promote the interests of the industry.&#xd;<br />3.Be an international hub for industry information and knowledge exchange.&#xd;<br />4.Lead best practice in ornamentals production","acronym":"AIPH","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Business and Industry, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Energy, Environment, Research and innovation, Trade","euInitiatives":"-Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 of the Parliament and of the Council of 6 April 2014.
