We cooperate with 520 partner universities in over 70 countries and are the only Swedish university to be a member of the strong international networks LERU (the League of European Research Universities) and Universitas 21. Two major facilities for materials research are currently under construction in Lund: the MAX IV Laboratory, which will be a world-leading synchrotron radiation laboratory and ESS, a European facility that will be home to the world’s most powerful neutron source. These will be of decisive importance for materials and life sciences and for industrial development. In Lund, Medicon Village has also been established and will offer a unique environment for life sciences; integrating research, innovation and enterprise creates the conditions for improved health and quality of life.","acronym":"ULUND","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Banking and financial services, Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Policy development for the European Research Area, EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation - Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, European Innovation Council, Higher Education Policy, Erasmus+","lastUp":"2019-04-15T09:31:53.219+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
