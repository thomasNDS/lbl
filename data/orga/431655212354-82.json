EMSP is the umbrella organisation representing 41 national member societies from 36 European countries. The organisation is acting on behalf of its members at European level and its efforts are directed towards achieving high quality equitable treatment and support for people with multiple sclerosis throughout Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EMSP’s mission is to improve the quality of life of more than 750,000 people living with MS in Europe and this can only be achieved by acting as a link between its member societies and the European MS community. EMSP is working closely with the MS community across the EU, including people with MS, advocacy organisations, healthcare professionals and researchers, alongside policy-makers in order to encourage meaningful change.","acronym":"EMSP","interests":"Budget, Communication, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, External Relations, Food Safety, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Youth","euInitiatives":"EMSP’s policy work is shaped by its over-arching goal of involvement of people with MS in all areas of EU policy, programmes and projects with an impact on health and disability. The European social and health policy landscape is becoming increasingly focused on broad themes and alliances, rather than on single conditions. EMSP will work closely to provide expert policy support and use MS as an exemplar of long-term, disabling, neurological conditions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EMSP’s activities, designed to support the defined policy-making and advocacy work in 2018, are part of the key operational objectives of the organisation in the year to come. As such, consolidating our relations to the EU Institutions and agencies, will help EMSP:&#xd;<br />1.\tStrengthen its role on the EU health scene and make MS, among other neurological diseases, a priority on the EU Health Agenda.&#xd;<br />2.\tImprove communication with member societies, as close communication with members of the EP is better achieved with the involvement of the actors from the national field. &#xd;<br />3.\tSpeak with one voice on behalf of people with MS in Europe. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />All our actions come as a consequence of our close consultations with our members and our activities are designed to improve the quality of life of people with MS in Europe. Recognising the value of our actions will make EMSP one of the key players in the field.","lastUp":"2020-01-08T15:18:34.012+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"700000-799999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
