The trade in unregulated and untested counterfeit goods poses a significant danger to consumers’ health, and costs governments around the world untold billions in lost revenues – funds that could be used to build schools, provide healthcare, and cut taxes.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We established CAIT to foster enhanced co-operation among stakeholders, share best practice, and discuss practical solutions to the problem. Industry involvement is vital, given its hard-won insights into markets, supply chains and effective control processes. Our members have significant experience in implementing track &amp; trace systems and authentication solutions. With CAIT, we have created a forum dedicated to advancing common technological standards – and to stepping up the fight against illicit trade worldwide.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our Mission&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Encourage collaboration and exchange best practice between industry, regulators and policymakers&#xd;<br />- Promote open technology standards to develop effective solutions in the fight against counterfeiting and illicit trade&#xd;<br />- Deepen our understanding of track &amp; trace and anti-counterfeiting technologies and their practical application&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Membership is open to all companies and organisations who share the coalition’s objectives and principles.","acronym":"CAIT","interests":"Competition, Customs, Economy, finance and the euro, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"Trade, IPR, Competition, Customs, Technology... and all legislative and other initiatives aimed at using technology to fight illicit trade","lastUp":"2018-10-10T14:25:05.974+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
