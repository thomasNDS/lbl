It is now widely recognised for its distinctive approach to viewing markets from the perspective of their contribution to social progress, and to upholding a respect for individuals and the importance of local initiative.","acronym":"AEIDL","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Banking and financial services, Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"AEIDL’s activities encompass sustainable local development in its broader sense. This includes sustainable development and the environment, territorial development (rural, urban, fisheries areas, regions), employment and social affairs, support to territorial authorities and businesses, and the promotion of democracy and citizenship.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />By developing know-how in these areas, and by sharing and transferring know-how (territorial policies in countries outside the EU, for example), AEIDL has accumulated an impressive stock of knowledge, both tacit and practical, and codified and technical.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />“Intelligent” development is development that takes the territory, solidarity and future generations into account.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AEIDL’s activities always include these three principles, even though each contract has its own dominant focus - which can be more environmental, more social or more territorial. Respect of these three principles has opened the door to the main projects in which AEIDL is or has been involved.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Environment&#xd;<br />Social development&#xd;<br />Territorial development&#xd;<br />Promising initiatives&#xd;<br />Refugees","lastUp":"2019-09-01T21:33:46.986+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"500000-599999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
