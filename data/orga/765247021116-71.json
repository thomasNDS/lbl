We work to promote and defend the rights of citizens to high social, labour, environmental, consumer and public health standards.&#xd;<br />The member organisations seek to improve social, environmental, labour, consumer, economic and public health standards for citizens and to continue building an inclusive and competitive Europe founded on economic, social and environmental sustainability.&#xd;<br />It is a shared concern that European legislation is increasingly presented by the European institutions and some member states as a burden when the vast majority of regulatory measures are essential for guaranteeing the rights of citizens, workers and the environment as well as the EU’s four freedoms.&#xd;<br />More concretely, there is common apprehension that the European Commission’s “Better Regulation” agenda does not further public interest, but rather aims to weaken or neglect essential regulations protecting workers, consumers, citizens and the environment. The focus of EU decision making should be on improving regulation, not deregulation.&#xd;<br />The Watchdog Network follows the EU’s Better Regulation Agenda closely and provides input into the processes and debates, raises awareness among stakeholders and society, and challenges the widely-held belief that regulation is a burden for society.&#xd;<br />The network shares information and expertise, but can also advocate its positions to decision makers, inform our networks about the consequences of the so-called Better Regulation agenda and participate in media outreach.&#xd;<br />The work of the network is coordinated by a steering group comprised of the following organisations:&#xd;<br />BEUC, the European Consumer organisation&#xd;<br />European Public Health Alliance&#xd;<br />European Environmental Bureau&#xd;<br />Finance Watch&#xd;<br />Friends of the Earth Europe&#xd;<br />UNI Europa&#xd;<br />Österreichischer Gewerkschaftsbund&#xd;<br />A full list of member organisations is available here: http://betterregwatch.eu/BRWN_members.pdf","acronym":"BRWN","interests":"Institutional affairs","euInitiatives":"The Better Regulation Watchdog Network focuses on initiatives and policies that directly relate to the Commission’s Better Regulation initiative. This includes meetings with the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, on the inter-institutional agreement on better law-making and on the Regulatory Scrutiny Board.","lastUp":"2019-02-15T12:31:38.662+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
