This way we could bring Europe closer to the Filipino migrants. When necessary we would also want to forward recommendations to the EU regarding policy lines on migration and development.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ENFiD also aspires to look into the policy lines regarding migration and development in EU and in the Philippines. We want to be able to identify if there is a gap between policies and implementation and where necessary, to forward recommendations to respective agencies.","acronym":"ENFiD","interests":"Climate Action, Culture, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Foreign affairs and security policy, Fraud prevention, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Regional Policy, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"EU-Diaspora dialogue/partnership&#xd;<br />Europe for Citizens Program&#xd;<br />EU Delegation to the Philippines&#xd;<br />Migration and Integration","lastUp":"2019-04-09T00:30:48.349+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
