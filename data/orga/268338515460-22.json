Originally a financial establishment for the French vegetable oil and protein subsidiary, Proléa, the group's investments and acquisitions have made it a major agri-food group in France today.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In creating Avril, the agri-food industry wanted to join forces on a common project : encouraging the development of France’s agriculture and agri-food industry by creating and distributing value equally within the vegetable oil and protein industry. Avril’s goal is to help create value at each level of the industry so that everyone can live better from their work.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Energy, Environment, Trade","euInitiatives":"RED and RED2, FQD, ILUC, Bioenergy policy, Decarbonisation of transport, EU protein plan, Rules of origin, Euromed, International climate policy","lastUp":"2019-02-26T10:03:32.140+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
