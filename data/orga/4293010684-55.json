We have three strategic aims: to ensure quality of life for all in a social Europe; link institutions of diaconia, social initiatives, and churches in Europe; and to be and enhance networks of competence.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Eurodiaconia is a member of the Social Platform. Rather than being merely interest representatives, NGO members of the Social Platform represent a structured voice of engaged citizens and civil society. They present the diversity of voices across Europe, channel viewpoints and values of thousands of people working at a grassroots level in the political decision-making process. Additionally, they make people and local organisations discuss European decision-making and propose appropriate measures to address these concerns.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In that respect, NGOs member of the Social Platform build European solidarity and help reduce the gap between politicians and citizens by enabling local organisations and people to participate in European decisions which have an impact on their lives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Eurodiaconia is committed to transparency about EU interest representation. Eurodiaconia believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide EU lobbying transparency. When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of Eurodiaconia, carry out such activities. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU.
