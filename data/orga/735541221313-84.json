We started in Bratislava and worked together with the city administrative, we currently engage at the state level, too.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are also working closely with experts on pedestrian needs, too. Our goal is to see more bicycles in the city, better walkability, and better overall traffic flow for all forms of transport. We have been successful in our efforts to increase the number of bicycle lanes in Bratislava and slowly also in other cities in Slovakia. Together with other organizations, we managed to include provisions which improve the safety of cyclists into the Slovak transportation law.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We would love to convince the decision makers in Slovakia to focus more on sustainable transport. EU strategy, policies, and regulations provide us a good argumentation basis and are an important factor in our dialog with politicians. In the process, we plan to engage also in influencing the EU institutions since we feel that the policies, although well-written, are not adequately reflected at the state(s) level.","acronym":"Cycling Coalition","interests":"Climate Action, Institutional affairs, Public Health, Regional Policy, Sport, Transport","euInitiatives":"We are just starting our EU initiatives. &#xd;<br />We plan to join:&#xd;<br />1. European Commission Annual Work Programme and Roadmaps,&#xd;<br />especially:&#xd;<br />- International Agreements, e.g. we have concerns related to planned TTIP agreement)&#xd;<br />- Climate Action initiatives, especially sustainable transport and reducing CO2&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. European Commission Impact Assessment&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Motivation:&#xd;<br />Generally, we feel that EU policies, although well-written, are not adequately reflected/implemented at the state(s) level.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />a) Sometimes, the root of the problem might be at the regional level (e.g. corruption) -- then it is useful to remember this at the EU level and set the EU policies adequately to mitigate (e.g. expect corruption and prepare audit controls to reveal the corruption).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />b) Sometimes, the problem might arise from inadequate synchronization/cooperation between EU institutions. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />For example, European Investment Bank is funding a project of bypass in Bratislava, which is problematic from both a) corruption b) not following the EU sustainable transport policies. This project might negatively influence the transport situation in Bratislava; bring more cars, noise and emissions into the city.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Another two NGOs (INEKO and Nadacia Zastavme korupciu) were filing a complaint with EIB to investigate the concerns (cf. EIB reference reference SG /E/2015/16). Our NGO filed a complaint addressed to the Prosecutor General in Slovakia and we plan to address the issue at EU level to prevent similar cases in future.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We also feel that there is a need to make EU processes more transparent and efficient.","lastUp":"2019-03-19T17:33:36.268+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
