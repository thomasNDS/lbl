After Brexit and the result of the election in the US we still hope,  that in the following years the economic progress of both continents will be determined by the development of the free trade agreements between Europe and the United States, we wish to take an active part in the preparation of this process. We wish to further the signing of this agreement with our extensive experience and contacts. We believe that in this question, the interests of the great powers overlap those of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) that form our alliance.","acronym":"GGI","interests":"Budget, Business and Industry, Competition, Customs, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"1.\tDevelopment&#xd;<br />2.\tEmployment and Social Affairs&#xd;<br />3.\tEnterprise&#xd;<br />4.\tTrans-European Networks&#xd;<br />5.\tEconomic and Financial Affairs&#xd;<br />6.\tEnergy&#xd;<br />7.\tEnvironment&#xd;<br />8.\tInternal Market&#xd;<br />9.\tRegional Policy&#xd;<br />10.\tTaxation&#xd;<br />11.\tBudget&#xd;<br />12.\tCompetition&#xd;<br />13.\tCustoms&#xd;<br />14.\tEnlargement&#xd;<br />15.\tExternal Relations&#xd;<br />16.\tHumanitarian Aid&#xd;<br />17.\tJustice and Fundamental Rights&#xd;<br />18.\tResearch and Technology&#xd;<br />19.\tTrade","lastUp":"2019-11-04T15:21:15.849+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
