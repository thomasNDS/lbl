We are representing the interests of maize producers from Romania at national and European level.

Finally, CEPM has launched a debate on the post-2020 CAP through exchanges with DG Agri, but also by assessing insurance systems (a common practice in the USA) and proposing&#xd;<br />alternatives (counter-cyclical payments) as  promoted by the Momagri think tank.&#xd;<br />MYCOTOXINS&#xd;<br />MARKET ACCESS MUST BE&#xd;<br /> MAINTAINED&#xd;<br />In the last few years, CEPM has been closely monitoring discussions on the mycotoxins issue, trying to reconcile consumer protection with economic fairness in the industry. CEPM was mobilised on this issue during the&#xd;<br /> implementation of regulatory and recommended thresholds. CEPM continued to take part in exchange forums organised by DG Sante, enabling regular updates on the implementation of regulatory legislation and the  progress in research. &#xd;<br />PLANT PROTECTION NEONICOTINOID MORATORIUM GOES ON&#xd;<br />Since 1 December 2013, following the vote on the moratorium, European maize producers no longer have access to certain neonicotinoid molecules (thiamethoxam, imidacloprid and clothianidin).&#xd;<br />Producers deplore this situation, which  prevents them from effectively fighting against certain soil-dwelling insects. Some countries have obtained derogations - within strict  conditions, but still with real effects - thanks to the political efforts of their governments.","lastUp":"2018-06-26T17:16:17.062+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
