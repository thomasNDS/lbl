In the past 2 years, LuCE organized two events hosted by MEPs to highlight the big inequieties still persisting for European lung cancer patients. We still consider these topics crucial, and because no so many tangible steps ahead were made, we are ready to organize a new event in EU Parliament, a roundtable, and with this purpose in July 12, we had a meeting with MAC Ms Peterle and his assistant Mr Nose in order to discuss about a new LuCE initiative for talking more about these inequities still persisting across Europe. Mr Peterle is going to host an event (MAC roundtable) on 16 November 2016, organized by LuCE where our Organization is presenting and circulating a wide report that collects updating data  about the Lung cancer scenario, and more specifically on the discrepancy still existing among European Member States.","lastUp":"2018-07-02T14:07:55.620+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
