In&#xd;<br />its Report, that continues to serve as operational blueprint for the Foundation, the High-Level Group stress education, skills&#xd;<br />and media to renew cultural dialogue, and foresee the centrality of civil society and investment in youth.&#xd;<br />Our programming is articulated around four&#xd;<br />priority strategic pillars:&#xd;<br />Advocacy and Research: Develop a proactive policy to embed Intercultural Dialogue&#xd;<br />policies at the local and national levels based&#xd;<br />on gathering of empirical data and platform&#xd;<br />for media dialogue.&#xd;<br />. Youth Voice and Exchange: Create&#xd;<br />opportunities for youth-led dialogue that&#xd;<br />generates alternative narratives, and provides&#xd;<br />next generations with the skills to build&#xd;<br />together more open, resilient communities.&#xd;<br />. Intercultural Learning and Cities: Enhance,&#xd;<br />embed and multiply intercultural dialogue&#xd;<br />capabilities of the different actors at local,&#xd;<br />national and cross-national level, with&#xd;<br />strategic focus on broadening intercultural&#xd;<br />. Networking and Cooperation: Facilitate&#xd;<br />the creation of Euro-Med collaborations&#xd;<br />and partnerships, map priority areas of&#xd;<br />intervention and synergies among dialogue&#xd;<br />actors, and support collective visible actions","acronym":"ALF","interests":"Borders and Security, Climate Action, Communication, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Environment, European Neighbourhood Policy, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"education&#xd;<br />(https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=legissum:4324360)&#xd;<br />intercultural dialogue (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2016-0005_EN.html)&#xd;<br />youth issues (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/education_training_youth/1504.html?root=1504)&#xd;<br />conflict prevention (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2019-0158_EN.html)","lastUp":"2020-01-14T15:54:49.942+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
