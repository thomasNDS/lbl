The CSC’s objective is to advance purified primary smoke products (“clean smoke”) for the smoking of foods (meat, fish, cheese and other foods) as well as the use of smoke flavourings. Clean smoke is substantially cleaner (environment), healthier (consumer safety), safer (work safety) and more easy to handle (SME-friendliness) and outperforms conventional smoking in all these fields. The same applies to the use of smoke flavourings in food processing. The association is advocating for a better suited regulatory framework for purifed smoke currently still suffering from misconceptions on the side of consumers and regulators.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The CSC works towards:&#xd;<br />-\ta EU regulatory framework better adapted to state-of-the-art smoke technologies &#xd;<br />-\tclear and truthful consumer information on CleanSmoke&#xd;<br />-\trecognition of CleanSmoke as the preferred option for the smoking of food in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) &#xd;<br />-\trecognition of CleanSmoke as a contribution to the protection of the environment, human health and work safety &#xd;<br />-\ta secured position of CleanSmoke in the production of organic food","acronym":"CSC","interests":"Agriculture, Climate Action, Consumers, Environment, Food Safety, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Single market","euInitiatives":"· Smoke flavours: Regulation 2065/2003 &#xd;<br />· Food information: Regulation 1169/2011&#xd;<br />· Organic food: Regulation 834/2007 / Regulation 2018/848 and implementing regulations&#xd;<br />· Quality policy: Regulation 1151/2012&#xd;<br />Residues and contaminants","lastUp":"2018-11-05T09:13:23.300+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
