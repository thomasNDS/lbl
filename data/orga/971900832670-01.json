It is responsible for the technical, nautical and commercial aspects of the port management.&#xd;<br />The port authority is responsible for large infrastructure works such as the construction of quay walls and jetties, terrain paving and road works. Also the maintenance of this infrastructure lies within its competence. Port terrains are given into concession to private operators (terminals). The private companies load and unload the ships of their clients and offer them storage facilities. In addition to the concessions, the Port authority has two other main sources of revenue : the duty on vessel tonnage and the duty on vessel cargo. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The coordination of the maritime traffic, the operation of the bridges and locks and the surveillance and security within the port borders fall within the competence of the Harbour Masters Office.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In addition, the Port authority assists customers in the development of their port activities. The authority is always on the lookout for new customers (shipping companies, stevedores, distribution companies) through worldwide port promotion at fairs, trade missions and port promotion days.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Port authority is also assigned to determine the port strategy and to optimize the opening-up of the port. In order to minimize the gap between port and society the Port authority must also inform the public on a continuous basis.","acronym":"Port Of Zeebrugge","interests":"Borders and Security, Climate Action, Competition, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, External Relations, Food Safety, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Migration and asylum, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"As Port Authority we follow EU legislation and upcoming proposals from the European Commission and Parliament and Council.
