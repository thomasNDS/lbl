A fairer way.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We want to see a world where the garment industry supports workers in realising their rights to safe, dignified, properly paid employment. This is why we focus on the most labour intensive parts of the supply chain, to find answers to problems others think are unsolvable.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We partner with brands and support workers. We take practical steps and test new solutions to show that it’s possible to make clothes in a fairer way. With other industry influencers, we push towards a new normal – creating change that goes far beyond our reach. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Together, we’re making fashion fair for everyone","acronym":"FWF","interests":"Employment and Social Affairs, External Relations, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Trade","euInitiatives":"The EU flagship initiative on the garment sector (2016/2140(INI))&#xd;<br />EU Directive 2014/95 on the  Disclosure of Non-Financial Information &#xd;<br />EU  2017/821 Conflict Minerals Regulation &#xd;<br />EU Regulation for Sustainability-related Disclosures in the Financial Services Sector&#xd;<br />Sustainable and responsible supply chains &#xd;<br />Trade for All&#xd;<br />European Development Policy&#xd;<br />EU Shadow Action Plan on responsible business conduct","lastUp":"2019-07-16T12:00:15.612+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
