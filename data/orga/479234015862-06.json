Ramping-up the digital arena: community building, a feeling of belonging, networking, knowledge transfers, exchanges of good practices, and so on.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. Lobbying French public institutions, major economic players, the media, and the European Commission.","acronym":"","interests":"Banking and financial services, Business and Industry, Competition, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Digital Economy : &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Digital Single Market&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Blockchain Observatory&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Digital Taxation&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Capital Markets Union","lastUp":"2019-02-20T10:38:52.724+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
