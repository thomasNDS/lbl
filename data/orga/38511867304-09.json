Together they represent over 26000 plant researchers and staff. In addition, EPSO has over 2600 personal members. EPSO collaborates with national learned societies active in plant sciences.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />The mission of EPSO is to promote plant science and plant scientists, to represent plant scientists in discussions about future plant science programme priorities across Europe, to provide an authoritative source of independent information on plant science, and to promote training of plant scientists to meet 21st Century challenges in breeding, agriculture, horticulture, forestry, plant ecology and sectors related to plant science.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />To achieve its mission, EPSO advises policy and decision makers at national, European and international level on science and science policy (science advice for policy), as an independent body and as member of the Initiative for Science in Europe (ISE) and the Global Plant Council (GPC)and in collaboration with FAO. EPSO supports plant scientists via the EPSO conferences including  EPSO Young Plant Scientist Awards, workshops, working groups and as information broker via EPSO News, Briefings and its website. EPSO initiated and coordinates the Fascination of Plants Day to foster the dialogue with society at large.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />EPSO’s strategy is defined by the representatives at the General Meeting and further elaborated by the elected Board. The strategy is implemented by the members and staff including various working groups.","acronym":"EPSO","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Communication, Education and training, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"o Support to the Joint Programming Initiatives ‘Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change’, Diet and Health’ and ‘Water’&#xd;<br />o Support the EC's European Innovation partnership on Agriculture&#xd;<br />o Observer of the ERA-Nets on Molecular Plant Sciences (ERA-CAPS) and on Sustainable Crop Improvement (SusCrop)&#xd;<br />o Advise on Crop Genetic Improvement Technologies&#xd;<br />o Advise on the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol&#xd;<br />o Advise on the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe)&#xd;<br />o Advise on the Common Agricultural Policy","lastUp":"2019-04-10T12:21:15.061+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
