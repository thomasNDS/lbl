This vision should manifest itself in a European Union that effectively protects human rights at home and is a force for positive change in the world.&#xd;\nIn pursuit of this vision, the network aims to influence EU and member state human rights policies and the programming of their funding instruments to promote democracy, human rights and sustainable peace.&#xd;\nParticipation in the network is open to non-governmental organizations which engage at EU level in the promotion of human rights, democracy and conflict prevention in and outside the EU. Applicants will be admitted to the network if none of the current members object. &#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\n- Crisis Action&#xd;\nCrisis Action is an international, non-profit organisation which aims to help avert conflicts, prevent human rights abuses and ensure governments fulfil their obligations to protect civilians.&#xd;\nCrisis Action works behind the scenes to support a diverse range of partners who are all concerned with tackling the immediate effects or long-term consequences of conflict. We aim to help them increase the impact of their responses to current and emerging conflict-related crises.&#xd;\n&#xd;\n- Fundamental Rights Platform&#xd;\nLaunched by the EU’s Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) in 2008, the Fundamental Rights Platform (FRP) is a network for cooperation and information exchange, set to act as the main channel for the FRA to engage civil society and to ensure a close cooperation between the Agency and relevant stakeholders.&#xd;\n&#xd;\n- HRC-Net&#xd;\nThe HRC-NET is a cross-regional network of human rights organizations from around the world that aims to share information and advocate at the Human Rights Council (HRC).
