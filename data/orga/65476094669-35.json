Through various forms of non formal and informal education it will raise awareness about rural areas in Europe and build a sense of tolerance and mutual understanding of the problems of youngsters leaving in rural areas. We believe that by this project we can empower young people to take an active role in the development of their own countries.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2016:Rising Temperatures, Rising Voices&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2014: Better together - we care about rural areas&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2013: Building Bridges for a more Inclusive Rural Europe&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2012: Let’s talk about diversity!&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2011: Rural Youth Attitude for European Development","lastUp":"2018-04-18T12:23:04.400+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
