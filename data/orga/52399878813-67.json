Criminal justice systems that respect the rule of law, uphold the rights of suspects and defendants and prevent the unnecessary use of pre-trial detention.&#xd;<br />2. Fair and proportionate sentencing that takes account of the circumstances of both the offence and the offender.&#xd;<br />3. Humane treatment and conditions for prisoners and prevention of torture in all places of detention.&#xd;<br />4. Safer communities through rehabilitation, reintegration interventions and interventions to reduce re-offending.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />To achieve our goals, we work as a catalyst for change through a smart mix of advocacy and practical programmes for reform. We work on four inter-connecting levels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We advocate criminal justice reform at national, regional and international levels, engaging with governments, authorities and inter-governmental organisations.&#xd;<br />Our regional offices deliver practical programmes, often in partnership with local civil society partners, promoting and implementing human rights and international standards.&#xd;<br />We develop and disseminate information and resources through our publications and this website.&#xd;<br />We build the capacity of local civil society organisations to address penal reform in their work and give them a platform to raise human rights issues with authorities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our current strategic plan covers priorities for 2015-2020 and is available at: https://www.penalreform.org/about-us/our-goals/","acronym":"PRI","interests":"External Relations, Justice and Fundamental Rights","euInitiatives":"PRI follows EU policy-making on criminal justice internally, and their external policies vis-a-vis 3rd countries that the organisation works in.
