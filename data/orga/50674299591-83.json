Because its member companies and associations are themselves engaged in international business, ICC has unrivalled authority in making rules that govern the conduct of business across borders. Although these rules are voluntary, they are observed in countless thousands of transactions every day and have become part of the fabric of international trade.&#xd;<br />Business leaders and experts drawn from the ICC membership establish the business stance on broad issues of trade and investment policy as well as on relevant technical subjects. These include: banking, commercial law and practice, competition policy, corporate responsibility and anti-corruption, customs and trade facilitation, the digital economy, environment and energy, intellectual property, marketing and advertising, taxation, and trade and investment policy.&#xd;<br />ICC works closely with the United Nations, the World Trade Organization and intergovernmental forums including the G20.&#xd;<br />ICC was founded in 1919. Today its global network comprises over 6 million companies, chamber of commerce and business associations in more than 100 countries. National committees work with ICC members in their countries to address their concerns and convey to their governments the business views formulated by ICC.","acronym":"ICC","interests":"Banking and financial services, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Consumers, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Energy, Environment, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"EU competition law and policy&#xd;<br />EU privacy and crossborder data flow policies&#xd;<br />EU VAT Experts Group&#xd;<br />EU ABS rules&#xd;<br />Article 55 Bank Recovering and Resolution Directive","lastUp":"2019-04-01T10:04:19.166+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
