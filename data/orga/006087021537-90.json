The EAPC provides a forum for all of those either working, or with an interest in palliative care throughout Europe and beyond. Currently the EAPC represents 59 member associations from 33 European countries and also has individual members from 52 countries globally.  Members are engaged in palliative care across the lifespan from a range of perspectives: specialist and generalist clinical practice, education, professional groups, policy and research.  The EAPC is respectful of the cultural and political diversity of our members and aims to speak with ‘one voice and one vision’ on matters that are important in palliative care.  The EAPC lobbies and advocates for the development of palliative care through its activities and through its work in developing the practice of palliative care.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Palliative care aims to improve quality of life for patients and their families who are living with a life-threatening condition. Palliative care aims to prevent or relieve suffering through early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other symptoms (physical, psychosocial and spiritual). Most people associate palliative care with cancer and indeed, historically and from a practice perspective, the management of symptoms in advanced cancer has been the cornerstone of the work of those working in palliative care. However, since the revision of the World Health Organisation definition of palliative care in 2002 palliative care is viewed as a model of delivering care that is applicable across a range of chronic life-limiting conditions beyond cancer.  This has been further confirmed by a recent resolution from the World Health Assembly which is aimed at strengthening palliative care across the life-span which recommends equitable access to palliative care regardless of a patient’s diagnosis.  The resolution provides an opportunity for the EAPC to engage with colleagues from other specialties to foster greater collaboration with the ultimate goal of an optimal quality of life experience for the patient and family in spite of their disease. Several such collaborations have been formed between the EAPC and organisations with mutual interests.","acronym":"EAPC","interests":"Education and training, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"The main focus of the EAPC is on EU policies and programmes in the field of Health as well as Research, Science and Innovation. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EAPC lobbies and endeavours to engage with the EU policy-makers and other stakeholders to advocate, anticipate and proactively shape EU health and research policies on palliative care issues.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Areas of EU Health and Research are of particular interest to the EAPC include: management and treatment of all life-limiting and chronic disease management across the lifespan. Access to Healthcare; Access to Medicines; Innovative Treatments; Quality of (Health)Care. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Specific legislative and related implementation acts that the EAPC follows include: Horizon 2020 and other research initiatives, Medicines Regulation (in particular access to controlled medication), Cross-Border Healthcare Directives, Human Rights etc. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EAPC also follows EU initiatives in the following broad areas: Social Affairs,Skills and Education, Digital agenda, Mobility, Human Rights and Children’s Rights, Justice, Disability, Employment, Consumers etc.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EAPC has, and continues to be involved in several European Union Funded research projects on palliative care.  As well as producing well-utilised guidelines on cancer pain management in 2001 and reviewing and revising the guidelines in 2012, the EAPC was also a partner in the European Union funded project, ATOME (Access to opioid medication in Europe). This project investigated the reasons why opioid medication was inadequately used for moderate to severe pain in twelve European countries and provided evidence to support improved access to opioids. The EAPC is also represented on the European Commission funded Civil Society Forum on Drugs. Whilst much of the work of this group focuses on the tackling the issue of illicit use of drugs, the EAPC provides an expert voice on access to opioids for pain management for those requiring palliative care. We are also currently lobbying to establish a Civil Society Forum on Palliative Care in order to advocate and lobby for access to and improvements in palliative care across Europe.","lastUp":"2019-11-27T10:17:28.089+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
