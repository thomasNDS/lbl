Our main objective is to promote a sustainable development, where environmental concerns, social justice and human well-being are main focal points. The Ecological Council is different from other Danish NGOs in the way that it is an academic organisation dealing with environmental policy on a scientific basis, but at the same time trying to inform and have a dialogue with both politicians and the general public.","acronym":"Ecocouncil","interests":"Agriculture, Climate Action, Energy, Environment, Taxation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Energy Union&#xd;<br />Common agriculture&#xd;<br />Reach implementation&#xd;<br />Decarbonisation&#xd;<br />Transport policy&#xd;<br />Electric Vehicles&#xd;<br />Energy labelling&#xd;<br />Ecodesign Directive&#xd;<br />Alternative INfrastructure Directive&#xd;<br />Energy Performance for buildings Directive","lastUp":"2018-07-03T15:37:40.910+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
