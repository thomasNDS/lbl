This situation is worse for critical and strategic metals. Critical metals are considered risky, in short&#xd;<br />supply or both by industrial sectors, for example metals for applications in electric vehicle or aerospace.&#xd;<br />Strategic and critical metals are essential to member states strategies, for example renewable energy policies.&#xd;<br />Therefore, future of European industries might be jeopardised by these dependences on strategic and critical&#xd;<br />metals imported from outside of Europe.&#xd;<br />It is this European strategic and critical metals dependency -notably out of China- that Neometal will&#xd;<br />contribute to solve because it aims to value European strategic and critical metals.","acronym":"neometal","interests":"Enlargement","euInitiatives":"les dossiers de la DG Grow concernant la politique minérale&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EIP raw Materials :European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials in the Commission Registry for Expert Groups.&#xd;<br />please laise with Alessia Rossi","lastUp":"2018-03-24T18:34:30.503+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
