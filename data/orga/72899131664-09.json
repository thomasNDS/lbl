Crisis Group’s reports, and the advocacy associated with them, aim to have direct impact on conflict prevention, management and resolution across the world. Crisis Group’s expert analysts engage directly with all parties to a conflict as they conduct research on the ground, share multiple perspectives and propose practical policy solutions. Increasingly, high-level interlocutors tell Crisis Group that its work in support of international peace and security has become indispensable.&#xd;<br />There are five main ways in which Crisis Group plays a key role in preventing and resolving conflict: &#xd;<br />(1) Ringing early warning alarm bells through its long-term presence in and coverage of many conflict situations, in its reports, briefings and commentaries, and in the monthly CrisisWatch bulletin (e.g. in Mali, Sudan, Iraq, Syria); &#xd;<br />(2) Producing independent and expert field-based analysis and advice on specific policy issues vis-à-vis scores of conflict or potential conflict situations around the world, helping policymakers in the UN Security Council, the European Union, regional organisations, donor countries and the countries at risk themselves do better in preventing, managing and resolving conflict;&#xd;<br />(3) Providing objective analysis and detailed actor mapping unobtainable elsewhere on developments regarding conflict, mass violence and terrorism (e.g. Libya, Yemen);&#xd;<br />(4) Offering new strategic thinking on some of the world’s most intractable conflicts and crises, challenging or refining prevailing wisdom (e.g. on Myanmar, South Sudan, Somalia, the Arab-Israeli conflict and Afghanistan/Pakistan); and &#xd;<br />(5) Focusing international attention on forgotten conflicts and peacebuilding processes (e.g. on Sri Lanka, Nagorno-Karabakh, Central African Republic) when the world’s attention has shifted elsewhere.","acronym":"ICG","interests":"Development, Enlargement, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Humanitarian Aid","euInitiatives":"Crisis Group monitors EU policy toward countries and conflicts covered by Crisis Group.
