We are a knowledge based organisation working on the forefront of livestock related issues in Europe. Our members are representatives from knowledge providers, industry organisations and farmers' organisations and have expertise of every aspect within the livestock value chain; from feeding and breeding to production and processing. We aim to create an integrated approach that is needed to contribute to the environmental and societal challenges our mission involves.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our goals are:&#xd;<br />- to stress the importance of sustainable livestock production for Europe’s future, and promote a positive image of the entire sector;&#xd;<br />- to act as the leading body of expertise on livestock production, and be recognised as such by European institutions, policymakers and industry;&#xd;<br />- to set a joint European research agenda for the livestock sector;&#xd;<br />- to provide informed commentary and start a dialogue with relevant EU Directorates on priorities for R&amp;D (and other) investment aimed at enhancing sustainable innovation;&#xd;<br />- to enable knowledge exchange amongst research providers, end-users and EU Directorates and enhance cooperation in European and interstate research and innovation;&#xd;<br />- to facilitate discussions on matters regarding future EU regulations that affect the sustainability and competiveness of the sector;&#xd;<br />- to assist European Technology Platforms in achieving their objectives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Key issues:&#xd;<br />Our work is focused on the entire livestock production chain. This concerns developing healthy, balanced and robust animals and new production systems, that are more efficient and environmentally friendly, producing high quality and safe food. This includes:&#xd;<br />- Sustainability issues;&#xd;<br />- Biobased economy;&#xd;<br />- Food quality, food safety, food security;&#xd;<br />- Animal health and animal welfare;&#xd;<br />- Finding new technologies that are acceptable to society;&#xd;<br />- Building competence.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Focus areas:&#xd;<br />The livestock sector is an important sector for realising a bio-economy in Europe. Research and innovation are essential to safeguard and improve livestock’s function in Europe as supplier of safe and healthy food, reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases, making better use of resources, meeting the needs of consumers in ways that are appreciated by society and contributing to a viable economy are to be met. We therefore focus our work on promoting knowledge development and innovation to enhance a sustainable and competitive livestock sector in Europe. Our main focus areas for promoting research and innovation are:&#xd;<br />- The Horizon2020 research and innovation programme 2014-2020;&#xd;<br />- The European Innovation Partnership - Agri;&#xd;<br />- The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Research &amp; innovation priorities:&#xd;<br />To promote the support for research and innovation that enhances a sustainable and competitive livestock sector for Europe, we created two White Papers with suggested research priorities in livestock science, that merit support under the Horizon2020 programme, the European Innovation Partnership and the CAP.&#xd;<br />Our White Papers identify key areas for research and innovation in livestock to support a smart, sustainable and competitive Europe.&#xd;<br />Key areas for research and innovation mentioned in our 1st White Paper:&#xd;<br />- Resource efficiency&#xd;<br />- Responsible livestock farming systems&#xd;<br />- Healthy livestock and people &#xd;<br />- Knowledge exchange towards innovation.&#xd;<br />Key areas for research and innovation mentioned in our 2nd White Paper:&#xd;<br />- Efficiency use of biomass - food security&#xd;<br />- Sustainable competitiveness of the livestock sector&#xd;<br />- Healthy livestock for healthy diets and healthy people.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />For more information, please visit our website: www.animaltaskforce.eu","acronym":"ATF","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Enlargement, Environment, Food Safety, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Regional Policy, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"Horizon2020 research and innovation programmes&#xd;<br />Era-Nets&#xd;<br />European Innovation Partnership for sustainable agriculture&#xd;<br />FACCE-JPI&#xd;<br />Common Agricultural Policy&#xd;<br />Bioeconomy strategy for Europe&#xd;<br />SCAR Standing Committee on Agricultural Research","lastUp":"2019-07-08T18:13:00.336+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
