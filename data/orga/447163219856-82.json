From enrolment to graduation, students are trained to assess the importance of academic problems and the relevance of selected theories and methods on a scientific basis. Project work is participant-directed and builds on the importance of student commitment and own and joint responsibility.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The phased choice of specialisation is based on the students’ experience with the problem areas of the individual subjects and the scientific approaches. Students gain their first experience at the basic studies, which point them in the direction of advanced-level courses, where many different specialised course studies may be combined within and across disciplines and main subject areas, both during the bachelor studies and the master’s studies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />At RUC, students are responsible for and control their education themselves. Based on their own critical sense and active participation, students are guided through their study programmes at RUC which offers an international, interdisciplinary and educationally challenging environment providing the perfect framework for their studies.","acronym":"RUC","interests":"Agriculture, Banking and financial services, Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Research&#xd;<br />Education &#xd;<br />Innovation&#xd;<br />Horizon 2020&#xd;<br />FP9&#xd;<br />Impact&#xd;<br />Regional&#xd;<br />Circular Economy&#xd;<br />Bioeconomy&#xd;<br />Science&#xd;<br />Social Sciences&#xd;<br />Humanities","lastUp":"2018-08-04T03:32:20.194+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
