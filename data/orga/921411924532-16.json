The most up-to-date list can be found here: http://home.frontiersin.org/about/institutional-membership","goal":"Frontiers is an award-winning Open Science platform and leading Open Access scholarly publisher. Our mission is to make research results openly available to the world, thereby accelerating scientific and technological innovation, societal progress and economic growth. We empower scientists with innovative Open Science solutions that radically improve how science is published, evaluated and disseminated to researchers, innovators and the public. Access to research results and data is open, free and customised through Internet Technology, thereby enabling rapid solutions to the critical challenges we face as humanity.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Founded in 2007, our Open Science platform has been adopted by more than 500’000 researchers, including 85’000 researchers from top institutions serving on the Frontiers journal’s editorial boards. We have published over 95,000 rigorously certified research articles, covering 500 academic disciplines. These articles have received 500 million views and downloads and over 700,000 citations (source: Scopus). As the 4th most cited publisher, several Frontiers journals are amongst the top most cited journals in the world. Frontiers publishes the top most cited journals in Neurosciences, Psychology and Plant Sciences, the 2nd most cited in Physiology, 3rd most cited in Microbiology and 5th most cited in Immunology.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As an IT company, Frontiers has developed its entire Open Science platform in-house, with feedback from many scientists. This allows us to consistently innovate powerful Open Science tools in general and Open Access publishing technologies in particular, some of which have been subsequently adopted by other publishers. These include:&#xd;<br />\t&#xd;<br />1. A cloud-based, scalable publishing engine supporting every phase of the publishing process.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. A virtual editorial office for editors that enormously enhances efficiency, oversight and quality control.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />3. A novel collaborative peer-review platform, where real-time interactions between editors, reviewers and authors are facilitated and enhanced with smart algorithms, cutting delays, and facilitating collaboration to improve article quality. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />4. An entire suite of article level metrics, measuring article and author impact. Impact metrics (e.g. views, downloads, citations, social media mentions and demographic information) provide objective and democratic ways to evaluate research, taking into account the profile, location and behaviour of readers.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />5. An academic network (launched in 2012 and rebranded as Loop in 2014) fully integrated into our publishing process and platform which provides:&#xd;<br />- Online profiles for authors, editors and reviewers, integrated into our research articles, journal webpages, editorial boards and review process, guaranteeing transparency and accountability of our peer-review process and high visibility to our users.&#xd;<br />- Dissemination of articles within relevant communities. This greatly enhances article views and downloads, not only of Frontiers articles, but articles published in other journals as well. Our smart algorithms massively improve research discoverability - indispensable in times of exponential growth of research output and papers.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />6. Frontiers for Young Minds, a scientific journal for children that translates cutting-edge research articles into kids articles and involves children in the review process.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />7. An Artificial Intelligence Research Assistant, currently in BETA, which enables reviewers and editors to control and maintain high quality research articles and makes it easier for authors to write high-quality manuscripts. This cutting-edge technology is the first-of-its-kind in academic publishing and is set to make the process of writing and reviewing academic papers more efficient than ever before. The first live version will be coming out in December 2018.","acronym":"","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"Frontiers is currently working on two Horizon 2020 projects:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1.H2020 - OpenMinTED: http://openminted.eu/about/&#xd;<br />OpenMinTED creates an open, service-oriented e-Infrastructure for Text and Data Mining (TDM) of scientific and scholarly content. Researchers can collaboratively create, discover, share and re-use knowledge from a wide range of text-based scientific related sources in a seamless way.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. H2020 - OpenUP: http://openup-h2020.eu/&#xd;<br />OpenUP addresses key aspects and challenges of the currently transforming science landscape and aspires to come up with a cohesive framework for the review-disseminate-assess phases of the research life cycle that is fit to support and promote Open Science. Its main objectives are to a) identify and determine ground-breaking mechanisms, processes and tools for peer-review for all types of research results (publications, data, software), b) explore, identify and classify innovative dissemination mechanisms with an outreach aim towards businesses and industry, education, and society as a whole, and c) analyse a set of novel indicators that assess the impact of research results and correlate them of channels of dissemination. The final result will be a set of validated policy recommendations and guidelines for national and European stakeholders, including EU institutions.","lastUp":"2018-10-23T15:56:39.949+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
