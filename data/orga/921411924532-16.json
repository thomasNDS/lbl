The most up-to-date list can be found here: http://home.frontiersin.org/about/institutional-membership","goal":"Frontiers is an award-winning Open Science platform and leading Open Access scholarly publisher. Our mission is to make research results openly available to the world, thereby accelerating scientific and technological innovation, societal progress and economic growth. We empower scientists with innovative Open Science solutions that radically improve how science is published, evaluated and disseminated to researchers, innovators and the public. Access to research results and data is open, free and customised through Internet Technology, thereby enabling rapid solutions to the critical challenges we face as humanity.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Founded in 2007, our Open Science platform has been adopted by more than 650,000 researchers, including 100,000 researchers from top institutions serving on the Frontiers journal’s editorial boards. We have published over 130,000 rigorously certified research articles, covering 600 academic disciplines. These articles have received 570 million views and downloads and over 1.1 million citations (source: Scopus). Frontiers ranks as the 5th most-cited publisher among the 20 largest publishers in 2019. Additionally, our analysis of the Journal Citation Reports and CiteScore metrics shows Frontiers journals rank among the most influential in their academic fields in terms of total citations - including top most-cited in neurosciences, microbiology, plant science and psychology.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As an IT company, Frontiers has developed its entire Open Science platform in-house, with feedback from many scientists. This allows us to consistently innovate powerful Open Science tools in general and Open Access publishing technologies in particular, some of which have been subsequently adopted by other publishers. These include:&#xd;<br />\t&#xd;<br />1. A cloud-based, scalable publishing engine supporting every phase of the publishing process.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. A virtual editorial office for editors that enormously enhances efficiency, oversight and quality control.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />3. A novel collaborative peer-review platform, where real-time interactions between editors, reviewers and authors are facilitated and enhanced with smart algorithms, cutting delays, and facilitating collaboration to improve article quality. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />4. An entire suite of article level metrics, measuring article and author impact. Impact metrics (e.g. views, downloads, citations, social media mentions and demographic information) provide objective and democratic ways to evaluate research, taking into account the profile, location and behaviour of readers.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />5. An academic network (launched in 2012 and rebranded as Loop in 2014) fully integrated into our publishing process and platform which provides:&#xd;<br />- Online profiles for authors, editors and reviewers, integrated into our research articles, journal webpages, editorial boards and review process, guaranteeing transparency and accountability of our peer-review process and high visibility to our users.&#xd;<br />- Dissemination of articles within relevant communities. This greatly enhances article views and downloads, not only of Frontiers articles, but articles published in other journals as well. Our smart algorithms massively improve research discoverability - indispensable in times of exponential growth of research output and papers.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />6. Frontiers for Young Minds, a scientific journal for children that translates cutting-edge research articles into kids articles and involves children in the review process.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />7. An Artificial Intelligence Research Assistant, which enables reviewers and editors to control and maintain high quality research articles and makes it easier for authors to write high-quality manuscripts.","acronym":"","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"- Horizon 2020 /Horizon Europe&#xd;<br />- Open Access / Open Science&#xd;<br />- Open Data / EOSC&#xd;<br />- EU copyright reform","lastUp":"2019-09-20T09:59:56.693+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
