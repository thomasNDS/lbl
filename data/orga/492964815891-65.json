They are self-governing communities of leaders of scholarly enquiry across all scientific disciplines. ALLEA and its Member Academies are independent from political, commercial and ideological interests. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Guided by a common understanding of Europe bound together by historical, social, cultural and political factors as well as for scientific and economic reasons, ALLEA’s mission includes to&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- promote the exchange of information and expertise between Academies,&#xd;<br />- foster excellence and high ethical standards in the conduct of research, as well as inter-, trans-, and multidisciplinary approaches in all scientific endeavours,&#xd;<br />- strive for autonomy of science and research and of scientific institutions, &#xd;<br />- represent the European Academies and bring forward their positions towards European authorities, &#xd;<br />- contribute with its “policy for science” work to improving the framework conditions under which science and scholarship can flourish in Europe and beyond. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Together with other pan-European academy organisations ALLEA strives for impartial and the best available scientific advice to a wide range of decision-makers and stakeholders in the science policy arena, informed by its disciplinary and interdisciplinary considerations. ALLEA aims to secure the preservation, protection and interpretation of the European cultural heritage.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ALLEA seeks to contribute to the process of European integration and to a close collaboration between EU and non-EU countries in Europe through its integrative membership comprising Academies both from EU and non–EU member states.","acronym":"ALLEA","interests":"Culture, Education, External Relations, General and Institutional Affairs, Information Society, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"ALLEA aims to secure favourable conditions for scientists and researchers in Europe, respecting excellence and autonomy as pre-conditions for any scientific entreprise. To that end&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- ALLEA working groups produce statements, memoranda and reports, &#xd;<br />- ALLEA helps install appropriate (digital) infrastructures for research not only, but especially also for the Social Sciences and Humanities,&#xd;<br />- Whenever support is needed for maintaining the autonomy, independence and excellence in science and research and of scientific institutions, particularly academies of sciences and humanities, ALLEA offers help and advice.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ALLEA supports and works towards the notion of a “cultural and intellectual Europe” beyond the Euro and the European Union. In order to do so, ALLEA &#xd;<br />- grants the \"All European Academies Mme de Staël Prize for Cultural Values\" to honour European scholars for exceptional contributions to common European values and identity, &#xd;<br />- has established a book series on pan-European topics,&#xd;<br />- holds symposia and workshops at different Member Academies as preparatory and/or accompanying activities to the book series. &#xd;<br />With these initiatives, ALLEA strives to support a new narrative for Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The core of the scientific work of ALLEA is done in the five Working Groups:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Intellectual Property Rights – be it patents or copyrights – play an important role in all academic activities. The permanent Working Group Intellectual Property Rights, which has been in existence since the 1990s, has prepared and issued reflections, declarations and recommendations on the most challenging topics of IP, including open access to scientific publications, stem cell research, the community patent or the grace period. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The permanent Working Group Science and Ethics is concerned with a wide range of problems, both internal (within the scientific community) and external (relations between science and society). Its capacities and activities have been extended during recent years in order to fulfil adequately the mission of collective deliberation on topics such as scientific integrity, research misconduct or ethics education among others. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Working Group Science Education is engaged in fostering science education and improving its quality as well as raising awareness for this issue among the society at large and policy makers in particular. The Working Group specifically promotes the concept of inquiry-based science education in order to adequately train school teachers at all levels of primary and secondary education. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The E-Humanities Working Group is charged with identifying and raising awareness for priorities and concerns of the Digital Humanities, and contributing to the Open Access agenda from a Humanities and Social Sciences perspective, and building consensus for common standards and best practices in E-Humanities scholarship and digitisation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Framework Programme 9 Working Group&#xd;<br />The ALLEA Framework Programme 9 Working Group aims to develop suggestions for the EU’s future research and innovation programmes which will be initiated after the conclusion of Horizon 2020, the EU’s current programme on research and innovation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Working Group Truth, Trust and Expertise is a transnational platform for perspectives on the nature of and relationship between truth, trust and expertise in the field of science. The expert group aims to interrogate and explore current and past dynamics of public trust in expertise and the contested norms of what constitutes truth, facts and evidence in scientific research and beyond. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ALLEA is active in preserving, interpreting and protecting the European cultural heritage. To this end, a detailed plan and programme for support within the European framework programmes is being developed.","lastUp":"2018-02-15T12:44:45.934+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
