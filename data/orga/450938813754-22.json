The exchange of scientific and technical information, the preparation of harmonised rules for the education and training of personnel involved in welding, joining and related technologies, and the encouragement of projects for co-operative research able EWF to act as the representative of the welding community in Europe.&#xd;<br />EWF, in conjunction with it's members, the relevant national welding institutes and organisations of 30 European countries, has made great efforts in the updating and harmonisation of training and education in the field of welding technology. It was a pioneering organisation in education and qualification, developing the first truly harmonised scheme embracing all European countries for the training of personnel at all levels, from crafts people to professional engineers.&#xd;<br />It started in the 1980’s an analysis of the existing levels of education in welding in the EU and EFTA countries and, upon the results, it was possible to define common harmonised levels of education, training and qualification. &#xd;<br />Aware of the importance of the mobility of labour within Europe, a lot of work has been put on the harmonisation of a standard examination system, to ensure that welding personnel trained in the EWF system is examined in a uniform way, allowing the implementation of the developed Certification system where the recognition of personnel skills is able according to the same minimum standard.","acronym":"EWF","interests":"Competition, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"EWF is particularly interested in following initiatives of harmonization and qualification in Europe, RTD policies in manufacturing and standardisation activities in joining and related aspects.","lastUp":"2018-03-26T09:49:39.155+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"900000-999999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
