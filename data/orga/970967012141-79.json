In 2018, the Slovak Republic became the 33rd ELRA member.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The primary purpose of ELRA may be described as the development and understanding of the role of land registration in real property and capital markets.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ELRA wants to promote a mutual understanding of land registers, to help create an open and secure Europe, serving and protecting citizens.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We believe that Land Registries are a fundamental pillar of legal certainty and ELRA is committed to ensuring the incorporation of this principal into Community Law.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />High level objectives:&#xd;<br />- To engage effectively with other members of ELRA to develop a pan European understanding on issues of common interest.&#xd;<br />- To engage effectively with the EU and where appropriate influence both the policy making and policy implementation in respect of issues of interest and concern. This may involve proactive consideration of policy instruments, legislation and regulations at their earliest draft stage.&#xd;<br />- To engage with third parties involved in European land market development and with land registration organizations worldwide.&#xd;<br />- To provide a receptive forum and network for the exchange of ideas.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The European Land Registry Network (ELRN) is a specific instrument of cooperation set up by ELRA in 2010 whose main objectives are to enhance the effective and practical application by Registrars of EU instruments, to establish and maintain an information system via the ELRN website among others.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The ELRN is made up by Contact Points (CPs) from ELRA national authorities. 29 associations from 22 Member States are currently represented by a registrar, public official or judge, from the national public entities and professional associations in charge of the Land Registry.","acronym":"ELRA","interests":"Banking and financial services, Competition, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and innovation, Single market","euInitiatives":"All the European initiatives in the following areas: &#xd;<br />- Cooperation in civil matters &#xd;<br />- Interconnection of land registries&#xd;<br />- e-Justice&#xd;<br />- electronic signature&#xd;<br />- data protection / data connection&#xd;<br />- mortgages&#xd;<br />- New Technologies: Artificial inteligence: blockchain, smart contract","lastUp":"2019-06-04T15:56:06.159+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
