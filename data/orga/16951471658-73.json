Institutional Representation: Through which it defends its members' interests in national and international forums.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. Economic and Regulatory Analysis: CECA carries out a comprehensive analysis of regulations in all the fields that can have a potential impact on its partners.&#xd;<br />Furthermore, it conducts economic studies that will be of interest to its members.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />3. Social Investment: One of the principal hallmarks of the companies affiliated to CECA is that they carry out their activities in a responsible way. The association works to disseminate and promote Social Investment, both in terms of Obra Social and CSR, from a sectorial perspective.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />4. Work Relations: The objective of CECA, as the employers' association of savings banks and institutions, is to defend the associated institutions that are bound by the Savings Banks and Financial Institutions Collective Agreement.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The 9 financial institutions represented by CECA account for (data December 2018):&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Total assets of 789,483 EUR Mill.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />32% of the sector in total assets. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />39% of the Spanish financial system in terms of deposits. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />12,246 branches in Spain (45% of
