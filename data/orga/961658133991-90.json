An increasing number of organisations are offering End to End encrypted messenger and email services, devices which provide turnkey solutions at the edge of domestic networks to protect communications, adblocking technologies, privacy focused search engines and much more.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />These organisations use their privacy enhancing solutions as a unique selling point with the aim of gaining a competitive advantage by building trust within their target markets. However, the markets in which they operate do not exist as a level playing field because in order to achieve their goals of strong data ethics they must go beyond mere compliance with the new regime of data protection and privacy laws whereas many of their competitors either work at the baseline required by law or simply take the risk of non-compliance in what has largely been a regulatory vacuum.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Think Privacy has worked with several privacy focused organisations in Europe over the past decade and lobbied on their behalf with significant success - but the cost of conducting such work on behalf of individual organisations is both a burden and inefficient.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Articl8 aims to bring to bear the weight of an entire privacy focused industry just as the anti-privacy lobby does for their members, spreading the cost of the lobbying across the entire industry making it much more efficient and increasing the impact due to being much more representational.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />This is a new approach, there has never been a pro-privacy industry group focused on lobbying for stronger fundamental rights - that is a task which has traditionally been reserved for civil society. But this new industry which has emerged in reaction to increasing concern over data ethics need to have their voice heard for fairer markets to develop and as a result see significant growth in their market share. A pro-privacy industry lobby is not just important from the perspective of enhancing fundamental rights, it is now an economic priority if these markets are to continue to grow.","acronym":"Articl8","interests":"Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and innovation, Single market","euInitiatives":"Draft ePrivacy Regulation&#xd;<br />General Data Protection Regulation&#xd;<br />Net Neutrality Directive&#xd;<br />Horizon 2020&#xd;<br />Regulation 1/2003","lastUp":"2019-02-18T12:32:02.999+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
