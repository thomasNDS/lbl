This helps us all to understand our cultural diversity better and contributes to a thriving knowledge economy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The objectives of the Europeana Foundation are &#xd;<br />• to make Europe's cultural and scientific heritage available through a cross-domain portal (Europeana.eu)&#xd;<br />• to work with museums, archives, audio-visual archives and libraries to deliver the portal and make it sustainable&#xd;<br />• to bring items that have already been digitised into the portal&#xd;<br />• to encourage and support the digitisation of more of Europe's cultural and scientific heritage&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />We work with a member-network of 800 institutions from every EU member state, who contribute digitised cultural heritage material to Europeana. At present, some 58 million heritage  items can be seen at the website Europeana.eu. The current strategy is to distribute material to social media sites and mobile platforms. To this end, we have developed an API, we are collaborating on the development of apps, and we are partnering with the Wiki community.","acronym":"Europeana Foundation","interests":"Budget, Communication, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Single market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Copyright reform&#xd;<br />Connecting Europe Funding&#xd;<br />MFF&#xd;<br />Digital Agenda&#xd;<br />Creative Europe&#xd;<br />Horizon2020&#xd;<br />Digital Europe Programme","lastUp":"2019-02-12T09:05:17.803+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
