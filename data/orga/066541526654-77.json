We formulate and promote economic policy solutions that strengthen individual opportunity, social cohesion and environmental stability. We pursue goals, not ideologies; we believe in the effectiveness of markets as well as in the need for appropriate policy frameworks; and we focus on bold but pragmatic and concrete steps rather than grand redesigns. Our impact is reflected in policy change.","acronym":"CEP","interests":"Banking and financial services, Budget, Competition, Economy, finance and the euro, Single market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), Taxation of the Digital Economy, TiSA, TTIP, Action Plan on Sustainable Finance","lastUp":"2019-04-07T19:27:12.134+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
