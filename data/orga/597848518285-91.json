Stop the uncoordinated and overwhelming increase in Wind Turbines; 2014:   25.000 in germany, that was 1 WT per 14,9 square km. Plans are to increase this number by the factor 3 which means there hardly remain livable areas for people and wildlife with 1 WT per 4,8 square km. The reality is much worse, as the windparks are concentrated preferably in the countryside, very often on wood covered hills, thus reducing the area for recreation and health and also the habitats of protected species like Birds (e.g. Red Milan) and Bats substantially.This development has to be stopped. Prices for Electricity go up constantly in Germany (presently 29 Ct./kWh compared to 18 Ct./kWh in 2004). Electricity Prices are second highest in Europe after Denmark. An effect on CO2 Emissions (see relevant statistics) is not measurable even if only Emissions from Electricity production are taken into account.","acronym":"VKO","interests":"Consumer Affairs, Energy, Environment, Justice and Fundamental Rights","euInitiatives":"1.
