Stop the uncoordinated and overwhelming increase in Wind Turbines; 2018: ca. 30.000 in Germany. Plans by DENA (German Energy Agency) are to increase this number to 120.000 in the year 2050 which means there hardly remain livable areas for people and wildlife. The windparks are concentrated preferably in the countryside, very often on wood covered hills, thus reducing the area for recreation and health and also the habitats of protected species like Birds (e.g. Red Milan, Black Stork, Buzzards) and Bats substantially.This development has to be stopped. Prices for Electricity go up constantly in Germany (presently 32 Ct./kWh compared to 18 Ct./kWh in 2004). Electricity Prices are the highest in Europe. An effect on CO2 Emissions (see relevant statistics) is not measurable even if only Emissions from Electricity production are taken into account.","acronym":"VkO","interests":"Energy, Environment, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health","euInitiatives":"1.
