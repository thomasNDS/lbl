It was chaired by Prof. Tadeusz Skoczny (CARS). It’s members were also: dr. E. Krakowińska and dr. M. Bernatt – from the University of Warsaw, Faculty of Management, as well as dr. D. Wolski, M. Radwański and G. Kaniecki – from the supplier and retailer firms.

The Working Group was guided by the principle of balancing the interests of those undertakings engaged in supply chain at its various levels with respect to good commercial practices. In every case where the Working Group was not able to find common conclusion, both retailers and supplier conclusions were presented separately. &#xd;<br />The response accessed at http://www.cars.wz.uw.edu.pl/doradztwo_gb-08.html &#xd;<br />3) Providing comments on the application of the General Block Exemption Regulation ('GBER').
