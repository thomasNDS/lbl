It fights for the protection and conservation of pollinators, notably bees, and promotes the transition towards alternative agricultural practices, away from the systematic use of pesticides.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />To pursue its goals, POLLINIS provides both the public and European policymakers with reports and information to support laws and policies that encourage sustainable agriculture. These practices have been proven to meet our food needs and are profitable to farmers, all the while preserving product quality, human health and the environment.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We believe that agriculture has a responsibility toward the people who consume its products and who, as taxpayers, indirectly finance massive farming subsidies. To give people a voice in the debate on European&#xd;<br />agriculture — the environment, well-being and food safety — POLLINIS raises citizen awareness through emailing campaigns and presents petitions to policymakers and institutions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />POLLINIS focuses on the following issues:&#xd;<br />- The protection of pollinators, particularly wild and honey bees.&#xd;<br />- The progressive ban of chemical inputs (pesticides, fertilizers).&#xd;<br />- Farmers’ self-sufficiency and satisfaction.&#xd;<br />- The promotion of alternative and sustainable agricultural solutions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In addition, POLLINIS identifies and financially supports successful alternative agricultural experiments. Consequently, we offer solutions to current agricultural&#xd;<br />practices so that food safety and the environment&#xd;<br />for future generations are assured and not threatened.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />POLLINIS is proud of its ideological independence. Framing practices today are rich in credible alternative experiments from various ideological and philosophical perspectives. We do not champion any particular one, as we are interested in investigating all plans that reject current intensive agricultural patterns and offer viable solutions for farmers, while producing healthy food and protecting nature.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Consumers, Education and training, Environment, Food Safety, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Trade","euInitiatives":"Policy areas of interest within the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development:&#xd;<br />- Plant health&#xd;<br />- Common Agricultural Policy&#xd;<br />- Direct support&#xd;<br />- Rural development&#xd;<br />- Agriculture and environment&#xd;<br />- Organic farming&#xd;<br />- Quality policy&#xd;<br />- Biotechnology&#xd;<br />- Research and innovation&#xd;<br />- Food and feed safety&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Policy areas of interest within the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Environment:&#xd;<br />- Chemicals&#xd;<br />- Nature and Biodiversity&#xd;<br />- Environmental Assessment&#xd;<br />- International Issues&#xd;<br />- Land&#xd;<br />- Soil&#xd;<br />- Water&#xd;<br />- Sustainable Development&#xd;<br />- Waste&#xd;<br />- Greening: Agriculture; Cohesion policy; European Semester; Internal Market; Research; Trade and External Relations&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Policy areas of interest within the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety:&#xd;<br />- Health&#xd;<br />- Food &#xd;<br />- Plants&#xd;<br />- Antimicrobial Resistance &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Subject areas of interest within the European Food Safety Authority:&#xd;<br />- Biological hazards&#xd;<br />- Chemical containment&#xd;<br />- Cross-cutting science&#xd;<br />- Food ingredients and packaging&#xd;<br />- GMO&#xd;<br />- Pesticides&#xd;<br />- Plant Health&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />European Commission initiatives of interest:&#xd;<br />- EU Pollinators Initiative&#xd;<br />- Next steps for a sustainable European future&#xd;<br />- Review of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020&#xd;<br />- Commission Delegated Regulation on rules for direct payments to farmers including greening&#xd;<br />- Review by the European Commission of National Action Plans established under Directive 2009/128/EC&#xd;<br />- Analysis of the interface between chemicals, products and waste legislation and identification of policy options&#xd;<br />- Communication from the Commission \"An Action Plan for nature, people and the economy\"&#xd;<br />- Communication from the Commission on an Action Plan on Environmental Compliance Assurance&#xd;<br />- Communication on Modernising and Simplifying the Common Agricultural Policy&#xd;<br />- Evaluation of the impact of the CAP measures towards the general objective \"viable food production\"&#xd;<br />- Horizontal or further sectorial EU action on whistleblower protection&#xd;<br />- EU action for sustainability&#xd;<br />- New skills agenda for Europe&#xd;<br />- Protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and the free movement of such data&#xd;<br />- White Paper on the future of the EU&#xd;<br />- Adapting a number of legal acts to Articles 290 and 291 TFEU (Commission delegated and implementing acts)&#xd;<br />- Certain aspects of company law.
