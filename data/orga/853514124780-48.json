RoA’s knowledge products are important tools that provide essential background for CSOs, and inform national and international lobby efforts to keep donors accountable towards their commitments for poverty eradication. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The five regions of the network are housed by different regional coalitions that represent participating partners in Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Europe, and non-European OECD countries. Through the regional nodes, the Network highlights regional perspectives on aid and development cooperation policies and practices, and facilitates capacity development towards increased capacity for lobbying, engagement, and coordination among CSOs in the different regions.","acronym":"RoA","interests":"Economy, finance and the euro, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development","euInitiatives":"EU International Cooperation and Development&#xd;<br />Building partnerships for change in developing countries","lastUp":"2018-11-06T12:45:15.146+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
