AFS traces its roots back to volunteer ambulance drivers who provided their service during the two World Wars; nowadays, AFS is a network of exchange organisations in over 60 countries. With the help of a large network of volunteers they organise short- and long-term intercultural stays abroad (pupil and volunteer service programmes) for over 13,000 young people every year. EFIL supports 30 European AFS organisations by promoting synergies and opportunities in the fields of intercultural learning and global education.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EFIL was established as an international, non-governmental organisation in 1971. Its original purpose was to co-ordinate existing programmes and to establish contacts and programmes in countries not yet involved in the network. Over the past years, EFIL’s scope has become much wider. EFIL is now more than a federation; it’s a partnership, a grouping of organisations committed to stand up for their common interest: providing intercultural learning opportunities to help people develop the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to create a more just and peaceful world.","acronym":"EFIL","interests":"Culture, Education and training, Enlargement, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Youth","euInitiatives":"COMMUNICATION Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture&#xd;<br />DECLARATION of EU Ministers of Education 'Promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, non -discrimination and tolerance through education'.&#xd;<br />COMMUNICATION A New Skills Agenda for Europe COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION on the validation of non-formal and informal learning.&#xd;<br />Erasmus+","lastUp":"2018-07-27T11:53:06.708+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
