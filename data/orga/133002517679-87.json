ACM provides the computing field's premier Digital Library and serves its members and the computing profession with leading-edge publications, conferences, and career resources.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The ACM Europe Council aims to increase the level and visibility of ACM activities across Europe. The Council is comprised of European computer scientists committed to fostering the visibility and relevance of ACM in Europe, and is focused on a wide range of European ACM activities, from high-quality ACM conferences in Europe, to expanding ACM chapters, to encouraging greater participation of Europeans in all dimensions of ACM.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />General Goals&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tPromote computing as a science and profession within Europe.&#xd;<br />•\tJoin with other computing and scientific organizations in Europe to offer educational and professional programs and activities.&#xd;<br />•\tPromote networking and information exchange among computing professionals within Europe and across the technical and scientific organizations. &#xd;<br />•\tProvide scientific and technical expertise to policy leaders throughout Europe.&#xd;<br />•\tPromote inclusiveness and excellence in computing education and the computing workforce.&#xd;<br />•\tEncourage nominations of ACM European members for the advanced ACM member grades of Senior Member, Distinguished Member, and Fellow.&#xd;<br />•\tIncrease the number of computing conferences in Europe. &#xd;<br />•\tExpand the ACM Distinguished Speaker Programme to include more experts from Europe and expand access to these lectures by European audiences.&#xd;<br />•\tIncrease the number of ACM chapters and level of chapter activity in Europe. The ACM-E Council of European Chapter Leaders (CECL) promotes networking among chapter leaders in Europe and helps grow more sustainable chapters. A mentoring programme enables existing chapters to mentor newer chapters and expand networking opportunities. CECL has been very effective in increasing the number of European participants in the ACM Distinguished Speaker Programme.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />More relevant to work and contacts with officials of the European Commission:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tRepresent the needs and perspectives of the computing community, both professional and academic, with the European Commission.&#xd;<br />•\tProvide scientific and technical expertise to the European Commission and government entities throughout Europe.&#xd;<br />•\tMonitor and provide input on European public policy: ACM-E established a policy subunit, known as EUACM, to address public policy issues relevant to the European computing community. Policy issues include digital government, digital society, electronic commerce, privacy and security, intellectual property, internet access, innovation, education, workforce development, and research and development.&#xd;<br />•\tProvide input on enhancing computing education excellence and inclusion. ACM-E and Informatics Europe established a joint Committee on European Computing Education (CECE) to focus on improving informatics and computer science education in Europe, including access, diversity, inclusive participation, and educational excellence. &#xd;<br />•\tProvide a forum for the exchange of information and knowledge about the European Commission's initiatives and programs with the professional, academic, and research computing communities and with other scientific and technical organizations.&#xd;<br />•\tDisseminate information through ACM-E, CECL, and ACM chapters in Europe about the European Commission’s initiatives and research programmes to computing practitioners, researchers, and research students. &#xd;<br />•\tPublish and disseminate information about the European Commission's technical and scientific activities to the computing community.","acronym":"ACM-E","interests":"Education, Environment, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"•\tACM Europe Policy Committee (EUACM) chair, Fabrizio Gagliardi, and other senior members of ACM interacted with senior EC officials and agreed that improving cooperation between the European Commission and ACM-E would be mutually beneficial.&#xd;<br />•\tEUACM monitors the policy activities of the European Commission and European governments as pertaining to the domains of computer science and computing, including the following areas of action:  &#xd;<br />o\tDigital Agenda for Europe&#xd;<br />o\tEducation and workforce development&#xd;<br />o\tCloud computing&#xd;<br />o\tCopyright in the digital environment&#xd;<br />o\tCybersecurity and privacy&#xd;<br />o\tEU-US free trade&#xd;<br />o\tEU strategic investment plan&#xd;<br />o\tFuture internet&#xd;<br />o\tResearch and innovation&#xd;<br />•\tACM-E is a resource for computing experts on relevant subjects. These experts could respond to specific requests from EC officers. ACM-E is proactively encouraging its members to register themselves in the European data registry of experts. &#xd;<br />•\tACM-W Europe works to fulfil the ACM-W mission in Europe. It supports, celebrates, and advocates for the full engagement of women in all aspects of the computing field. It provides a wide range of programs and services to ACM members and works in the larger community to advance the contributions of technical women.&#xd;<br />o\tACM-W Europe held its first event at Manchester University in March 2014. The womENcourage Celebration of Women in Computing brought together more than 200 practitioners, career researchers, and students to present, share, and celebrate their technical accomplishments and experiences working and studying computing.&#xd;<br />o\twomENcourage has become a regular event, with the next one taking place in Linz, Austria in September 2016","lastUp":"2018-01-31T12:26:43.717+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
