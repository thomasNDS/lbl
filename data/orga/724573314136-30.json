Supported Employment assists people with disabilities (physical, intellectual, psychiatric, sensory and hidden) to access real employment opportunities, of their own choice, in an integrated setting with appropriate ongoing support to become economically and socially active in their own communities.&#xd;<br />EUSE works to achieve this through the promotion of the Supported Employment model, the exchange of information and knowledge on good practice in Supported Employment and the development of model services. EUSE provides a platform for networking with other organisations and  associations at European and worldwide level.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Role and Activities&#xd;<br />The main activities of the European Union of Supported Employment include:&#xd;<br />• Organising the EUSE Conference, which is held bi-annually. The next conference is in May 27-29 2019 in Amsterdam.&#xd;<br />• Exchanging information via different channels: regular email, website (www.euse.org),  councilmeetings (twice a year), skypecalls, sharing of documents.&#xd;<br />• Influencing European social and economic policy.&#xd;<br />• Networking with other European Associations and working with worldwide organisations.&#xd;<br />• Developing new National Associations – assisting and supporting organisations to establish their own National Associations&#xd;<br />• Campaigning and lobbying for the rights of people with significant disabilities to access vocational training and employment.&#xd;<br />• Researching and developing models of good practice, quality standards and legislation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EUSE is a non-Government organisation and is a member of the European Disability Forum (EDF).","acronym":"EUSE","interests":"Business and Industry, Communication, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Youth","euInitiatives":"EUSE follows all policies, initiative and legislative files that could have an impact on the labour inclusion of disadvantaged groups, especially those related to fundamental rights, citizenship, employment and social policies","lastUp":"2019-02-25T13:13:11.243+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
