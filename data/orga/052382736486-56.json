We have introduced the first-ever Toyota into Europe and are still going strong in this partnership. But the way how people will be moving around in the future will change drastically and again the Debono Group wants to take a lead in Malta and help the transformation towards shared, connected, electric and autonomous mobility. We started a year ago the only car-sharing business on the island with our Israeli partner Car2Go and launched this year ride pooling through ViaVans. We have the largest EV Charging Infrastructure in the country and more services linded-up. We strongly believe that sharing economy and multi-modal transportation is the way forward to bring congestion down and improve the quality of life through better health.","acronym":"DGHL","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Digital economy and society, Energy, Environment, International co-operation and development, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Transport","euInitiatives":"Urban Mobility&#xd;<br />Electric Vehicles&#xd;<br />Autonomous Vehicles&#xd;<br />Energy&#xd;<br />Environment &amp; Climate Change","lastUp":"2019-11-06T10:27:07.934+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
