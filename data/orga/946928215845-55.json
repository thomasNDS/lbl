All mobile operators in Finland abide by strict net neutrality principles: operators do not apply vertical price-discriminations. Despite the mass-affordable open mobile internet offers and very heavy mobile data traffic the Finnish telecom sector generates healthy returns for its investors (16% ROCE for the market leader operator).&#xd;<br />INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY&#xd;<br />Rewheel is fully independent from dominant telecom companies, equipment vendors and their industry lobby organisations such as GSMA, ETNO or ECTA. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our independence and integrity is demonstrated by the strong and straightforward, pro-competition public positions taken in top business media such as the Financial Times, Reuters, Bloomberg, European Voice or the Wall Street Journal. We are often quoted on the hottest industry topics - in 2014 it is whether telecom and competition regulators should allow in-market consolidations leading to higher operator profits or the opposite: promote stronger infrastructure and spectrum based competition, leading to faster networks and more affordable mobile connectivity prices for consumers and higher utilisation of scarce spectrum resources. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our consulting firm's small size and financial independence allows us to be selective on our engagements. If a client's objectives are in conflict with our general pro-competitive stand point, we do not undertake the project.&#xd;<br />ONLY SENIOR CONSULTANTS&#xd;<br />Rewheel is privately owned by its founders Antonios Drossos (managing partner, Linkedin profile) and Pál Zarándy (senior partner, Linkedin profile). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Monitoring mobile internet access competitiveness in Europe and OECD countries","acronym":"","interests":"Competition, Digital economy and society, Single market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Electronic Communication Framework legislation (e.g. Connected Continent regulation, net neutrality, roaming, spectrum etc.)&#xd;<br />Telecom Single Market&#xd;<br />Telecom consolidation and merger control","lastUp":"2019-03-16T07:02:20.770+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":"0-99999"}
