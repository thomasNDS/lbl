It is an umbrella structure of national associations of laboratories, European sectorial organisations of laboratories or laboratory practitioners, and international partner or sister institutions.&#xd;<br />EUROLAB’s overall objective is to voice the opinion of European laboratories on political and technical matters affecting them at the European and international levels. In 2002 amendments to the EUROLAB Articles of Association were initiated to cope more with the international laboratory behaviour. Since and through co-operation with European and international technological partner organisations, through regular contacts with the European Commission and the European and international accreditation bodies (EA, ILAC)   and through representation in standardisation committees (CEN, ISO), EUROLAB can effectively represent the interests of its members which are made up of four categories of members, i.e. 21 Active Members, 3 Associated Members, 1 Observer Member and 2 International Members, including i.a. NCSLI (National conference of standards laboratories International - USA), ASCOLAB (Congo) and NLA (National laboratory association of South Africa).","acronym":"EUROLAB","interests":"Business and Industry, Consumers, Customs, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Trade","euInitiatives":"The main focus areas for EUROLAB in the last years were the revision of the Blue Guide, the revision of ISO/IEC 17025? the revision of the Medical Devices Directives, the Consumer Safety and Market Surveillance Package and generally all legislation related to the New Legislative Framework and the Alignment Package.
