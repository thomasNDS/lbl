Many projects are located in regions that receive hardly any public attention in the outside world. &#xd;<br />The aim of our work is always to provide access to health care for people in crisis situations independent of their ethnic, social, religious and political origin - which means that we oppose every form of exclusion. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />National projects: we support health-care programmes for those on the fringe of society not only in the so-called developing countries, but also in Europe. In 2018 the network members carried out 162 health programmes in their respective home countries. With our projects in Germany – “open.med” in Munich, \"open.med\" in Berlin, \"Migrantenmedizin Hamburg\" in Hamburg and “Med.Mobil” in Stuttgart – we offer medical care to people without access to the health system. Target groups are people without access or with only limited access to the national health system. Amongst them are people without papers, nationals and EU citizens without health insurance, asylum seekers, homeless people.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Making human rights violations public&#xd;<br />Together with our project work, we consider it our duty to document eye-witness reports and violations of international humanitarian law. We make society and those responsible in politics and business aware of the difficult living conditions of our target groups of patients and we are engaged at a European and international level to provide general access to health care as a human right for all.","acronym":"","interests":"Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Public Health, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Currently Ärzte der Welt e.V. follows DG Sanco, DG Justice, activities of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) and the European Programme for Integration and Migration (EPIM).","lastUp":"2019-04-26T14:59:49.970+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
