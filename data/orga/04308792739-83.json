Many projects are located in regions that receive hardly any public attention in the outside world. &#xd;<br />The aim of our work is always to provide access to health care for people in crisis situations independent of their ethnic, social, religious and political origin - which means that we oppose every form of exclusion. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />National projects&#xd;<br />We support health-care programmes for those on the fringe of society not only in the so-called developing countries, but also in Europe. In 2015 the network members carried out 190 health programmes in their respective home countries. With our projects in Germany – “open.med” and \"ÄdW mobil\" in Munich, \"open.med\" in Berlin, \"Hoffnungsorte\" in Hamburg and “Med.Mobil” in Stuttgart – we offer medical care to people without access to the health system.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Making human rights violations public&#xd;<br />Together with our project work, we consider it our duty to document eye-witness reports and violations of international humanitarian law. We make society and those responsible in politics and business aware of the difficult living conditions of our groups of patients and we are engaged at a European and international level to provide general access to health care as a human right for all.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Ärzte der Welt e.V. beobachtet derzeit DG Sanco, FRA und den Europäischen Hilfsfonds für die am stärksten benachteiligten Personen (EHAP).","lastUp":"2018-04-23T16:24:34.655+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
