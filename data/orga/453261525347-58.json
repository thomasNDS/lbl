Education, information resource, support, patient advacacy, research and fundraising for people affected by PSC are a few areas we will cover. In all our activities, we try &amp; incorporate the 'peadiatric element', as we are convinced it is necessary for all stakeholders to realise our children can not be overlooked.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are strong believers that there should be a lay version of every scientific and medical article and report related to PSC available in open source and in as many European languages as possible. We state 'The lay version is the ultimate completion of the scientific article'. So far, the feedback from the doctors and researchers has been great and PSC Patients Europe has been approached by researchers, doctors and the industry to work on the lay versions and to set criteria to do so.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We feel privileged to be able to share our knowledge and experience with others on a national and international level. This also includes sharing patient expertise to .e.g. other patient organisations and on an EU level.","acronym":"PSCPE","interests":"Consumers, Public Health, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Patient involvement in research&#xd;<br />EU Health related-issues&#xd;<br />ERN RARE-LIVER&#xd;<br />Rare disease topics&#xd;<br />HTA&#xd;<br />EMA Patient Expert&#xd;<br />Salzburg Global seminar","lastUp":"2019-12-23T19:40:20.396+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
