COMECE is formed by the Bishops' Conferences of the European Union's Member states.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The COMECE Secretariat, as a Church representation, fully supports the goal of bringing greater transparency to the legislative and policy-making process at the EU level, as an important element of a democratic and pluralistic society, and for this reason and in this spirit entered the present registration system in 2011. However, it also advocates for a re-balancing of the burden of transparency, currently placed more on citizens and organisations, rather than on public officials. Furthermore, the risk of exclusion of actors that enjoy no \"formal status\" (e.g. migrants, the elderly, the poor, Roma people, informal youth groups, social movements), due to the lack of specific provisions to allow for access to decision-makers, is a source of concern. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We recognise ourselves in the definition of ‘Organisations representing churches and religious communities’, as contained in the 2014 Agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission on the transparency register for organisations and self-employed individuals engaged in EU policy-making and policy implementation (“Legal entities, offices or networks set up for representation activities”). We also fully support the idea that the register does not apply to Churches themselves, as specified in the Agreement.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />However, we would like to emphasise that the lobbying and/or interest representation terminology (still used in a generalised way e.g. in the introductory sentence to the Code of Conduct; in various passages of the ‘Guidelines’ document; and in the Proposal for an Interinstitutional Agreement on a mandatory Transparency Register) cannot be applied to us as a Church representation. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />On the basis of Article 17(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), we are involved in Dialogue with the EU institutions as a representation of a Church entity, having a specific contribution to make to the common good and a peculiar identity, status and dignity, not as a lobby group or interest representative or single-issue organisation. We see our contribution as being mainly of a moral and ethical nature, but also rooted within the Social Doctrine of the Church. This contribution is constantly inspired by the Gospel and by the Catholic Church’s reflection on the dignity of each human being as created in God’s image. We operate in search of the common good, not in the name of ‘business’ or ‘interests’ (as typical features of lobbying and interest representation). Finally, we are not conditioned by third-parties' interests.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />COMECE emphasises that registrations under Section V of the Transparency Register should be consistent with the binding formulation of Article 17 TFEU. Therefore, registration in the present Section should concern only \"organisations representing\" the actors described in Article 17, paragraph 1 TFEU.","acronym":"COMECE Secretariat","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Banking and financial services, Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"The Future of Europe; Multiannual Financial Framework; Implementation of the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief; Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU; General Data Protection Regulation; Compliance with fundamental rights and the rule of law (e.g. crimininalisation of circumcision); Revision of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive; Countering “fake news”; Proposal for an Interinstitutional Agreement on a mandatory Transparency Register; Cross-border family law; Reconciliation of family and professional life; European Solidarity Corps; European Pillar of Social Rights; EU-Africa Summit; European External Investment Plan (Private Investment &amp; Development); European Defence Fund (European Defence Industrial Development Programme); A Strategic Approach to Resilience; Shrinking civil society space in developing countries; Eastern partnership Summit; Trade policy; EU Strategy for “A credible enlargement perspective for and enhanced EU engagement with the Western Balkans”; Digital and biotechnological innovation (monitoring EU support for research and innovation under the special focus of ethical implications for the human being and society: Artificial Intelligence, Nanotechnology, biotechnological innovations e.g. gene-editing); EU Health Policy (monitoring EU support for health under the special focus of ethical implications for human dignity: EU Health Program, eHealt/digital health and care, EU One Health Action Plan); Common European Ayslum System (CEAS) reform; European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018; Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy; Anti-Microbial Resistance.","lastUp":"2019-04-05T09:32:12.320+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1250000-1499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
