It pioneered the guarantor loan concept in the UK, which is a personal loan for which interest and principal payments are guaranteed by a second individual, typically a family member or friend with a stronger credit profile than that of the borrower. It offers a single, simple product, which is a guarantor loan under which individuals are currently able to borrow between £500 and £10,000 over a term of between 12 months and 60 months at a standard annual percentage rate of 49.9% (which equates to a flat interest rate of 41.16%) with no fees, hidden charges or redemption penalties charged by Amigo.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />With a guarantor loan product, payments are guaranteed by a guarantor, meaning Amigo has recourse to a second individual. A guarantor loan also enables a relationship driven loan arrangement which Amigo believes provides potential benefits to all parties. The majority of its borrowers are not able to access mainstream finance due to having a thin, poor or no credit record with credit reference agencies. With a guarantor loan product, borrowers benefit from access to finance which would not otherwise be available to them and a means of building or rehabilitating their credit scores. The guarantor benefits by assisting the borrower, with whom they typically have a close existing relationship. As lender, Amigo benefits as the borrower is more incentivised to ensure payments are made on debt guaranteed by a relative or friend. This mutually beneficial relationship between lender, borrower and guarantor is at the core of its business.","acronym":"Amigo","interests":"Banking and financial services","euInitiatives":"Consumer Credit initiatives including cross border and online credit availability","lastUp":"2019-04-10T11:31:55.478+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
