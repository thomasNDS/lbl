External quality assurance, for which QA agencies are responsible, fulfils a different need: at its best it combines both accountability for the reassurance of the public and an objective and developmental role for enhancing quality in institutions. The role of national authorities is to define the given national QA setup and to ensure that the national QA system operates in harmony with the ESG.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ENQA is committed to respect the fitness for purpose principle (purpose-process alignment) that is at the core of the European dimension of quality assurance.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ENQA considers the autonomy of institutions and independence of quality assurance agencies within national HE systems as a necessary condition to ensure the full exercise of their responsibilities, notably with regard to the provision of accurate and consistent information to the general public.","acronym":"ENQA","interests":"Education and training, External Relations, International co-operation and development, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"ENQA was created following the Recommendation of the Council on European co-operation in quality assurance in higher education of 1998 and the Bologna Process in 1999. ENQA has been involved in the Bologna Process since the beginning. ENQA takes part in the Bologna Follow-UP Group (BFUG) meetings on a regular basis as a consultative member.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2003, the Ministers of the Bologna Process invited ENQA, through its members, in cooperation with EUA, EURASHE and ESIB (now ESU) to develop \"an agreed set of standards, procedures and guidelines on quality assurance\". The result of this cooperation is the \"European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (ESG)\" which were presented to the Bologna Follow-Up Group on 1 March 2005 and submitted at the European Ministers of Education meeting in Bergen in May 2005. Currently, a new version \"the ESG 2015\" adopted by the Ministerial Conference in May 2015, Yerevan is being used for cyclical evaluations of quality assurance and/or accreditation agencies or bodies. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ENQA holds two statutory events on an annual basis: 1) ENQA General Assembly and 2) ENQA Members' Forum.&#xd;<br />These events present an opportunity for ENQA to present to its members and affiliates the recent developments in QA on the European level as well as ENQA past activities' results and to agree on the future activities. It is also a communication platform for members and affiliates who gather and share their ideas and good practices.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In addition, ENQA is involved in EU-funded projects as partner (http://www.enqa.eu/index.php/projects/enqa_projects/).","lastUp":"2019-02-21T15:05:36.528+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"900000-999999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
