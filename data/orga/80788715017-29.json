Fertilizers Europe represents the major fertilizer manufactures in the EU. Its members account for approximately 70-80% of the region’s fertilizer production capacity and around 70% of phosphate fertilizer production. As an industry association, Fertilizers Europe’s mission is to identify, promote and manage the common interests of its members. It aims to fulfill this mission by explaining and promoting the role of fertilizers in European agriculture and horticulture, by anticipating and preparing for emerging issues that may affect the industry, by speaking on behalf of its members, and by providing them – and other interested parties – with a wide range of statistical information and studies. The issues that the industry devotes its attention to may be matters that have prompted concern within the industry itself (related, for example, to its competitiveness and Product Stewardship); they may, on the other hand, have arisen in EU institutions or other sectors of society in connection with the production or use of fertilizers.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Customs, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Research and innovation, Single market, Trade, Transport","euInitiatives":"The main EU initiatives followed are generally related to trade or regulatory issues. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Within trade our main concerns are free trade agreements and other trade concessions having an impact on the fertilizer market. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Another important aspect are policies related to energy and especially gas since a well functioning gas market is critical to our industry. This also has trade implications.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Regulatory affairs involve energy and climate change issues since the fertilizer industry is energy intensive. As the number one exposed sector on the EU's carbon leakage list the EU's ETS system is a key policy area.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The use of our product is regulated by Agricultural and Environmental policies such as CAP, agri-environmental schemes, nitrate directive, clean air legislation, water and it has links to the circular economy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Obviously, standards relating to our products like the fertilizer regulation is another key area. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Best production practices described in the so called BREF must also be followed and acted upon.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Fertilizer security and chemical safety throughout the production chain also falls within the remit of the association.","lastUp":"2019-02-25T13:08:54.126+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"800000-899999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
