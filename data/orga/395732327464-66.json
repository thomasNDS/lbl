The  Geneva  Association  identifies  fundamental  trends  and strategic  issues  where  insurance  plays  a  substantial  role  or  which  influence  the  insurance  sector.  Through  the  development  of  research  programmes,  regular   publications and the organisation of international meetings, The Geneva Association serves as a catalyst for progress in the understanding of risk and insurance matters and acts as an information creator and disseminator. It is the leading voice of the largest insurance groups worldwide in the dialogue with international institutions. In parallel, it advances—in economic and  cultural  terms—the  development  and  application  of  risk  management  and  the  understanding  of  uncertainty  in  the modern economy.","acronym":"Geneva Association","interests":"Banking and financial services, Climate Action, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Public Health, Single market","euInitiatives":"- Climate-related policies &#xd;<br />- Cross-border insurance&#xd;<br />- Cyber security&#xd;<br />- Data usage policies&#xd;<br />- Environmental Liability Directive&#xd;<br />- Solvency II/ capital standard&#xd;<br />- FinTech&#xd;<br />- Insurance regulatory developments&#xd;<br />- Interest rates&#xd;<br />- Liability and insurability&#xd;<br />- Long term investment&#xd;<br />- Occupational pensions&#xd;<br />- Pensions&#xd;<br />- Recovery and resolution&#xd;<br />- Reinsurance&#xd;<br />- Supervision&#xd;<br />- Technology","lastUp":"2018-06-15T10:10:57.032+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
