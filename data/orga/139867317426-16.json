The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Energy and Environment jointly founded us in 2005. As a non-for profit organisation, we focus on the promotion of sustainable patters of consumption and production (SCP). In cooperation with the governments around the world, we are working towards a more sustainable future especially in the frame of recently adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We adopt an inclusive and holistic approach to foster sustainable consumption and production with expertise in the areas of Products and Services, Cities &amp; Infrastructure, Policy, Lifestyles &amp; Behavior and Business &amp; Entrepreneurship. Within these areas, both the think and do tank services are offered in collaboration with our partner organizations across the globe. We search, develop and replicate sustainable practices in above areas in order to achieve a resilient and sustainable future for all.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The key to our work as reflected in our name is the multi-stakeholder approach. Hence, we work with businesses, NGOs, policy makers as well as consumers and their representative organizations for transition towards a sustainable future planet.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In policy realm, the Centre provides advice to policy decision makers on the selection and implementation of best policy mixes for business and civil society activation for SCP implementation at different levels of politics and governance. With businesses, we work to foster sustainability practices along the global value chains and demonstrate the case for social entrepreneurship.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In addition, we also work with Civil Society organizations and engages them in the formulation and implementation of policy due to their close connection to diverse groups of society and ability to catalyze change.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our organization consists of four teams 1) Sustainable Infrastructure, Products and Services (SIPS) 2) Sustainable Business and Entrepreneurship (SBE) 3) Sustainable Lifestyles and 4) Enabler Team who provides project management, IT, creative as well as acquisition support to aforementioned three teams.
