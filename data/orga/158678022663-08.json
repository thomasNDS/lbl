EUWMA members are public institutions with legal powers. EUWMA was established in 1996 with the primary aim to increase cooperation between European Water Management Associations, so as to provide relevant information, position papers and policy documents to national governments, the European Commission, the European Parliament and other relevant institutions. In addition, EUWMA promotes the exchange of knowledge and best practices between members.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In our view, EU water legislation can only be successful if water is managed at regional level. As water challenges vary in different river basins, solutions should be tailored to local conditions, rather than the ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach often favoured by national government departments.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Good and efficient water management is what we stand for, at regional and national level as well as in Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Objective:&#xd;<br />EUWMA aims to increase cooperation between its members, so as to provide information, views, position papers and policy documents to governments, the European Commission, the European Parliament and other institutions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Activities:&#xd;<br />•Holding meetings to exchange views and formulate policies on matters of common interest.&#xd;<br />•Jointly considering proposals by the European Union and submitting joint proposals.&#xd;<br />•Exchanging proposals to national governments on European issues.&#xd;<br />•Keeping members updated on developments that could impact on flood protection and land drainage.&#xd;<br />•Exchanging administrative and technical information and publications of common interest.&#xd;<br />•Seeking collaboration in research and development.&#xd;<br />•Organising a yearly general meeting and workshops on relevant themes.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture, Climate Action, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Taxation","euInitiatives":"- Kaderrichtlijn water&#xd;<br />- Flooding directive&#xd;<br />- Urban Waste water treatment directive&#xd;<br />- European Innovation Partnership (water) &#xd;<br />- CAP&#xd;<br />- Water reuse&#xd;<br />- Prioritiy substances&#xd;<br />- water scarcity and droughts&#xd;<br />- nature policy (birds and habitat)&#xd;<br />- Right to water initiative&#xd;<br />- groundwater directive &#xd;<br />- circular economy package&#xd;<br />- TTIP-CETA&#xd;<br />-","lastUp":"2018-07-06T11:04:53.389+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
