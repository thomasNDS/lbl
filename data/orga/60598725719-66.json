The Built Environment is a place of tightly interconnected private &amp; public infrastructure. Its composition and dynamic are very complex, since it offers and is associated to a lot of various services which support our day-to-day life. The Built Environment serves a lot of industries and services (transport, energy, citiesâ€¦). It impacts therefore the performance of many sectors. The Built Environment is also our major living environment; this is the place (homes, offices, transport infrastructures, cultural places, etc.) where we spent more than 80% of our time. The quality of the Built Environment therefore directly impacts the quality of our life. Last but not least, paramount challenges such as energy, climate change, efficiency, safety and more generally sustainability prove to become of utmost importance for the Built Environment and very often need to be tackled within an integrated approach.&#xd;<br />The main mission of ECTP and its committees (including one on Energy Efficient Buildings) is to develop new R&amp;D&amp;I strategies to improve competitiveness, meet societal needs &amp; take up environmental challenges through an Innovative Built Environment.&#xd;<br />ECTP mobilises stakeholders to deliver on agreed priorities and share information across the EU. ECTP is an independent and self-financing entity. It conducts its activities in a transparent manner and is open to new members.","acronym":"ECTP","interests":"Business and Industry, Digital economy and society, Energy, Environment, Research and innovation, Transport","euInitiatives":"Horizon 2020, EeB PPP&#xd;<br />SET Plan, EIP SCC, EIP AHA&#xd;<br />TRA&#xd;<br />HORIZON EUROPE","lastUp":"2020-01-09T08:59:44.111+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"500000-599999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
