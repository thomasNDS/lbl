We are working towards a world free from the fear of heart and circulatory diseases.

But we cannot stop now.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />By 2030, we want to see advances across the spectrum of heart and circulatory diseases; we want to prevent these conditions from developing and we want those with existing conditions to have better, longer lives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We fund research to save and improve lives. As the largest independent funder of research into heart and circulatory diseases in the UK, we will focus our efforts on accelerating discovery and turning discoveries into life-saving medical advances.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We work with patients and the public for better health and care. As the UKâ€™s heart charity, we advocate for and with people affected by heart and circulatory diseases.
