These offerings include our core enterprise operating system platform, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, our enterprise middleware platform, Red Hat JBoss Middleware, as well as our virtualization, cloud, and storage offerings and other Red Hat enterprise technologies.&#xd;<br />  &#xd;<br />We employ an open source software development and licensing model that uses the collaborative input of a worldwide community of contributors to develop and enhance software. We actively participate in this community-oriented development process, often in a leadership role, and leverage it to create our Red Hat- and JBoss-branded enterprise technologies.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />We believe that the open source development and licensing model offers advantages for Red Hat and our customers over proprietary software development and licensing models. Through the open source development model, we leverage a global community of developers and users, whose collective resources and knowledge supplement the developers we employ. As a result, we believe we are able to offer enhancements, fixes and upgrades more quickly and with less development cost than is typical of many proprietary software vendors. In turn, our customers are able to take advantage of the quality and value of open source software, which we help develop, aggregate, integrate, test, certify, deliver, maintain and support for their enterprise use.","acronym":"Red Hat","interests":"Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Competition, Culture, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Foreign affairs and security policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Youth","euInitiatives":"(A) DSM initiatives, notably:&#xd;<br />(i) Legislative proposals for a reform of the copyright regime; &#xd;<br />(ii) Cyber -PPP, -Act, -Strategy, and, Implementation of NIS;&#xd;<br />(iii) Priority ICT Standards Plan and overlap with IP;&#xd;<br />(iv) Initiatives on data ownership, free flow of data (between cloud providers &amp; across borders) and European Cloud Strategy; &#xd;<br />(iv) e-Government Action Plan &amp; implementation of Tallinn Declaration&#xd;<br />(B) R&amp;D&#xd;<br />- H2020 &amp; emerging technology","lastUp":"2019-02-08T19:04:26.036+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
