It has also actively engaged in the recruitment of leading applied agricultural scientists from larger universities to create a critical mass of researchers that in many aspects (including agricultural engineering and agricultural entomology) is unique in the UK. The whole-institution focus on agricultural science presents a wide range of inter-disciplinary research opportunities, including in postgraduate training. Some of these opportunities are supported by University research centres aimed at fostering new approaches to agricultural practice. These include the National Centre for Precision Farming, the Centre for Integrated Pest Management and others named in the submission. The University is not simply UK focussed. It has research connections with a number of leading overseas universities (for example, Cornell University, China Agricultural University, Aarhus University) and is engaged in several overseas projects with industry, including, for example, a collaboration to replicate its UK-based controlled-traffic farming research on a demonstration farm in Zambia. These connections will enable students to engage with basic-science researchers, not only in the UK, but also with leading agricultural faculties and companies internationally.","acronym":"HAU","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Borders and Security, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Migration and asylum, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"We are collaborators on two active H2020 projects, and we have staff working with collaborators for the next H2020 deadline.
