Geneva Call gives ANSAs the opportunity to adhere to and respect the norms of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and Inter- national Human Rights Law (IHRL). Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions provides a solid basis for humanitarian engagement with ANSAs, by establishing the right for impartial humanitarian organizations to offer their services to the parties to a conflict. To achieve this, Geneva Call seeks a formal undertaking by ANSAs, inviting them to sign and comply with different Deeds of Commitment to respect these norms. Signatory ANSAs agree that Geneva Call will monitor and verify their compliance. Geneva Call is currently focusing its efforts on banning the use of Anti-Personnel mines, protecting children from the effects of armed conflict, prohibiting sexual violence in armed conflict and working towards the elimination of gender discrimination. Geneva Call also responds to ANSA requests to help build their knowledge of, and capacities to implement, IHL and IHRL. Geneva Call conducts its activities according to humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence. Transparency is also a core working principle: as a matter of policy, Geneva Call informs stakeholders, including the States concerned, of its engagement efforts with ANSAs.","acronym":"Geneva Call","interests":"External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Justice and Fundamental Rights","euInitiatives":"Geneva Call is following files on the protection of civilians from the effects of armed conflict and the humanitarian engagement with armed non-State actors.
