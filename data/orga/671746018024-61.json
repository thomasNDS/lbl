The ECEAE is the only European organisation exclusively representing animals used in scientific procedures.  The ECEAE is an umbrella lobbying organisation with considerable legal, campaigning and scientific expertise.  It is an independent organisation funded exclusively by donations from individuals, and from its member organisations.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The ECEAE is opposed to all experiments on live animals as a matter of principle, and campaigns for an end to their use for this purpose in the EU.  Our approach is based on the principle that animals are sentient beings and that it is therefore morally wrong to knowingly inflict suffering to them when it is not for their benefit and they are not able to give consent.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The ECEAE highlights the increasing evidence that experimentation on animals can be scientifically unreliable, and that continued reliance often remains for historical and bureaucratic reasons.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />While animal experiments continue, the ECEAE campaigns for the maximum protection of animals in laboratories, to ensure that these animals receive the legal protection they are supposed to under EU and Member State legislation and supports initiatives to develop new methods to reduce their suffering, reduce their numbers and ultimately replace their use.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Originally, the ECEAE was created in 1990 to campaign for a total ban of cosmetic testing on animals in Europe.  However, long before the successful inclusion of the animal testing and marketing bans in the Cosmetics Directive in 2013, the ECEAE began to focus on all EU legislative and policy developments relating to animal experimentation. The ECEAE now also leads Europe-wide proactive public campaign and projects aiming at enhancing the protection of animals in European laboratories and raising awareness of the use of animal in experiments.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The ECEAE regularly responds to EU animal testing issues such as, chemicals, nanotechnology, botulinum toxin testing, food safety and human and veterinary pharmaceutical testing. The ECEAE produces thoroughly researched and very well-received scientific reports on these issues and information packs to provide decision makers and the public with up to date information on the science behind animal testing and the law governing it.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The ECEAE is a registered observer at the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and is also an invited interested party at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As a member of the International Council on Animal Protection in Pharmaceutical Programmes (ICAPPP), the ECEAE comments on International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines for the safety and efficacy testing of human pharmaceuticals and also VICH guidelines which are the equivalent for veterinary pharmaceuticals.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The ECEAE is also a member of the International Council on Animal Protection at OECD (ICAPO), which has expert observer status at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which seeks to harmonise protocols for the testing of chemicals.","acronym":"ECEAE","interests":"Agriculture, Consumers, Environment, Food Safety, General and Institutional Affairs, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"Discussion with Commission and Parliament on European policy.&#xd;<br />Revision of Directive 86/609/EEC on the use of animals in experiments:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />REACH:&#xd;<br />-Response to the public consultation on the scope of Reach&#xd;<br />Tests Methods Regulation:&#xd;<br />-Correspondence with the European Commission on the process of validation of alternative methods at EU level&#xd;<br />Veterinary Medicines legislation:&#xd;<br />-Response to European Commission consultation&#xd;<br />European Citizens Initiative&#xd;<br />-Response to European Commission public consultation","lastUp":"2018-06-22T16:15:14.263+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
