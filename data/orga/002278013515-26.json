We started in 2010 to solve a simple problem: how do you get access to a ride at the touch of a button? More than 10 billion trips later, we're building products to get people closer to where they want to be. By changing how people, food, and things move through cities, Uber is a platform that opens up the world to new possibilities.","acronym":"","interests":"Business and Industry, Competition, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Employment and Social Affairs, Research and innovation, Single market, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Innovation policy; Digital Single Market; Internal Market policy; Competition policy; Urban transportation; Mobility","lastUp":"2019-05-03T23:11:19.700+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"800000-899999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
