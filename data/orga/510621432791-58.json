The algorithm enables interpretation and understanding of the contextual meaning in Big Data.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />This technology is not a search engine, but a knowledge base, which is 100% self-learning and does not require any language packages or word banks. By studying the data, our system will be able to understand words and expressions, dialects and misspellings, any jargon, irony or emoticon, in all languages and alphabets.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Anzyz Technologies has worked together with SÃ¸rlandet Hospital in Kristiansand, Norway, to develop a Clinical Decision Support System for identifying and classifying allergies of concern for anesthesia during surgery. The system is used every day at the hospital. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Healthcare is just one of the many areas where this technology can be applied. Anzyz offers customized applications to fit specific needs, within a variety of different fields.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Anzyz aims to become one of the leading providers of cutting edge AI-technology.","acronym":"","interests":"Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Communication, Consumers, Digital economy and society, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"Anzyz follows the development of an EU AI-strategy closely.
