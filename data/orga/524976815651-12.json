The CER is pro-European but not uncritical. We regard European integration as largely beneficial but recognise that in many respects the Union does not work well. We also think that the EU should take on more responsibilities globally, on issues ranging from climate change to security. The CER aims to promote an open, outward-looking and effective European Union.","acronym":"CER","interests":"Borders and Security, Budget, Climate Action, Competition, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, Foreign affairs and security policy, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"The Centre for European Reform covers a wide range of policies and legislative files related to our main areas of interest.
