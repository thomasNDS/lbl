Every year, about 1400 researchers from over 40 countries visit the ILL and 640 experiments selected by a scientific review committee are performed. Research focuses primarily on fundamental science in a variety of fields: condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology, nuclear physics and materials science, etc.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Whilst some are working on engine designs, fuels, plastics and household products, others are looking at biological processes at cellular and molecular level.  Still others may be elucidating the physics that could contribute to the electronic devices of the future. ILL can specially tailor its neutron beams to probe the fundamental processes that help to explain how our universe came into being, why it looks the way it does today and how it can sustain life. &#xd;<br />The ILL also collaborates closely and at different levels of confidentiality with the R&amp;D departments of industrial enterprises.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />All the scientists at the ILL - chemists, physicists, biologists, crystallographers, specialists in magnetism and nuclear physics - are also experts in neutron research and technology and their combined know-how is made available to the scientific community.","acronym":"ILL","interests":"Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"ILL is a European Intergovernmental Research Organisation (EIRO).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ILL is involved in European projects since 1990.&#xd;<br />ILL is obviously interested in Research &amp; Innovation, current and future framework programmes.","lastUp":"2019-08-23T12:07:37.996+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
