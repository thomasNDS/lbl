Creativity Works! stands for imagination, innovation, freedom of expression and cultural diversity. Europe thrives on these values. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our objective is to inform EU policymakers and citizens alike about the economic and cultural contribution made by creators, cultural and creative sectors in the digital age. Our goal is to have an open dialogue with European audiences and decision-makers about the challenges we all face: our online world has to provide fair and equal opportunities for all individuals to flourish, including creators as well as current and emerging businesses. Striking the right balance in this context will ultimately benefit citizens and consumers, safeguard and create jobs, and help to promote cultural diversity.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CW! does not have its own offices, or any legal personality. CW!’s secretariat is managed on a rotating six-months basis among its trade association members.
