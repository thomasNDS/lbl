Fair, democratic, accountable and transparent governance – at local, national, regional and global level where all countries have a say, and all people can exercise their right to participate. Finance that serves the people – and helps ensure human rights for all, and an environmentally sustainable planet. This means it is publicly regulated to meet social ends and recognise environmental limits, and enhances systems of redistribution to ensure economic justice. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Eurodad's key strengths include:&#xd;<br />Our deep and detailed understanding of the issues we work on. &#xd;<br />Our respected position with other allies and civil society networks, and our work with global and regional coalitions, in particular, our ability to develop joint strategies within our membership network, and our strong cooperation with allies from the global south.&#xd;<br />Our good connections to policy-makers and other influencers.&#xd;<br />Our ability to develop results-focussed strategies, and track progress to our goals. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We adopt a flexible approach to the role we play, ensuring we focus on what our most useful contribution can be – in any given situation – to making the desired transformative policy change happen, recognising the strengths of our members and partners. We prioritise cooperation with partners from the global south, seeking to work in partnership whenever possible, to listen to and respect their priorities, and to try to align ourselves to those.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Eurodad has existed since 1990 and has been registered as a non-profit organisation in Belgium since 2005.
