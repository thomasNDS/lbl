EU Cohesion Policy has provided the second pillar upon which cross-border cooperation has developed – and these two pillars comprise the policy framework within which the Centre has operated in recent years. The June 2016 Referendum on the UK’s Withdrawal from the EU has, however, significantly altered the policy environment in which the Centre is active.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Centre is an independent company limited by guarantee (UK charity no. XR 31047), founded in 1999 by Queen’s University Belfast, Dublin City University and the Workers Educational Association.","acronym":"CCBS","interests":"Agriculture, Business and Industry, Customs, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, General and Institutional Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Given the remit and goals of the Centre for Cross Border Studies (CCBS), the overarching EU policy and its implementation that is most relevant to the organisation is Cohesion Policy, and most particularly (although not exclusively) European Territorial Cooperation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Therefore, CCBS is also interested in legal instruments aimed at facilitating cross-border cooperation, such as Integrated Territorial Investment and EGTCs, as well as the implementation of the Partnership Principle.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CCBS is now also focused on the EU and UK ‘Brexit’ negotiations and the related policy and position papers, particularly how the negotiations and their outcomes are impacting and can be expected to impact on the island of Ireland.","lastUp":"2018-10-31T10:15:12.627+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
