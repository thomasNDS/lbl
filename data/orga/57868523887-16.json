Since that date, the European Disability Forum has played a key role in ensuring that all relevant European Union policies and initiatives take persons with disabilities into account.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EDF focuses on the implementation and monitoring of the UN CRPD in all policy areas of the EU, including in the EUs international cooperation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EDF has no political or religious affiliation; it does not represent any specific interest or country and it is not a European institution or body.","acronym":"EDF","interests":"Borders and Security, Budget, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"EDF promotes the implementation and monitoring of the CRPD in all policy and legislative processes of the EU.
