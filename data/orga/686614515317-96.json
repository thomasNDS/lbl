Specialists in cane sugar refining, the business has around 250 direct and contract employees manufacturing sugar at our refinery in Lisbon. It is part of ASR Group.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Sidul is almost unique in Europe in focusing solely on cane sugar. Our cane sugar supply chain stretches across developing countries around the world.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In Europe, sugar is manufactured from both sugar beet and sugar cane. The two models have co-existed since the early 1800s. A competing sweetener, isoglucose manufactured from cereals, now also plays a role in the European sugar market.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Sugar is a very heavily regulated market in Europe. Cane sugar currently accounts for around 17% of the total sugar and isoglucose availability in Europe. Beet sugar accounts for around 78% and isoglucose around 5%. In the global sugar market the situation is the reverse, with cane sugar playing the lead role. Cane sugar accounts for around 78% of total sugar production, with beet accounting for 22%.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Around 70% of Europe’s cane sugar imports are typically sourced from developing countries with which the EU has a preferential trading relationship. These relationships are formalised under both the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and the Everything But Arms Agreements (EBA). The remaining 30% of cane sugar imports are largely sourced under the “CXL” quota. This is a quota that exists as a result of trade negotiations with countries that previously supplied countries that have subsequently joined the EU. Most of this sugar is subject to a €98 per tonne import duty.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The operation of the EU sugar market is governed by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Until 2017, this sets production limits, through quotas, for beet and isoglucose, and defines the terms for importing from preferential and other cane sugar suppliers. High import duties exist for imports sourced from outside of the preferential suppliers. The basic import duty for cane sugar is €339 per tonne, but can be supplemented by further duties when world prices for sugar are low.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />After 2017, the quotas for beet and isoglucose will disappear, but the duties on raw sugar imports will remain.","acronym":"SIDUL","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Climate Action, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, General and Institutional Affairs, Internal Market, Trade","euInitiatives":"Main EU initiatives included:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- campaigning for a level playing field in tehe EU sugar market, in particular as regards access to raw material for cane sugar refiners&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- building relationships with Members of the European Parliament, in particular following the introduction of co-decision in European Agriculture Policy&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- building relationships with the new European Commission and the Permanent Representations in Brussels&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- following various international trade dossiers&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- following various development dossiers&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- following various competition dossiers","lastUp":"2018-01-15T10:22:51.457+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
