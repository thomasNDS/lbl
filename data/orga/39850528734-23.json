As the governing body for the Bar its role is to promote and improve the services and functions of the Bar, and to represent the interests of the Bar on all matters relating to the profession, whether trade union, disciplinary, public interest or in any way affecting the administration of justice, be that by way of structural change, or changes to substantive or procedural law.  The Bar Standards Board was established by the Bar Council to deal with the regulation of barristers. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since much of the law of England and Wales originates from the institutions of the European Union, in 1999 the Bar Council opened a representative office in Brussels, to act as the Bar’s eyes, ears and mouth at the heart of EU decision-making.  It keeps the Bar informed of EU developments on a wide range of issues that directly affect its practitioner members and their clients.  It also acts as the central conduit for communicating the knowledge and expertise of the English Bar to European policy makers, much of it generated by Specialist Bar Associations working within the Bar Council’s structure, and coordinated by the Bar Council’s EU Law Committee.","acronym":"The Bar Council","interests":"Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Competition, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, External Relations, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Single market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"All files in the Justice field, both civil and criminal and whether substantive or procedural.
