It is vital that the EU pursues a policy that strengthens the accessibility of Europe’s secondary and tertiary destinations both through direct connections and through European hubs to maintain and develop connectivity and consumer choice on a long term, always in a fair and competitive environment, both within the EU and with regards to non-EU competitors.&#xd;<br />Aviation is fiercely competitive. Airlines can compete provided there is a level playing field, therefore E4FC continues its effort to enforce international and EU-level aviation and trade rules, ensure fair and equitable competition and a satisfactory level playing field.","acronym":"E4FC","interests":"Competition, Economy, finance and the euro, External Relations, Single market, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"E4FC is stressing the crucial importance of an EU-based airline industry which serves Europe’s strategic interest, creates jobs, provides connectivity for its citizens, protects consumers’ interest, reinforces investments and the competitiveness of the European economy.","lastUp":"2019-12-09T16:43:37.848+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
