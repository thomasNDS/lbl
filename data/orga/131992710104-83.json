AFEMS is a Europe-wide association. Founded on the principles of cooperation and dialogue, it provides a forum for its network of members, a hub of information on sporting ammunition and a means of responding effectively to technical, scientific and legislative challenges.It represents a network of manufacturers and distributors of ammunition, components, clay targets and machinery, each boasting vast experience and a long history in the industry. Despite their different backgrounds, they all share a common goal: to protect and grow activities related to sporting ammunition.&#xd;<br />AFEMS is regarded as the sole spokesperson and representative for the entire European ammunition industry. And AFEMS works actively with the European Commission and the European Parliament to influence drafting and implementation of legislation on the production, classification and distribution of related products. &#xd;<br />AFEMS is also considered the main hub through which its members can obtain information, exchange views and work together to tackle the technical, scientific and legislative challenges.&#xd;<br />Strengthening dialogue and cooperation among its members, and representing their interests to the relevant decision-making bodies, are therefore clear priorities for AFEMS.&#xd;<br />The key benefit of AFEMS membership is the opportunity to network. As well as meeting individuals who share a common interest, you will develop many new, professional relationships. Our members particularly value the contacts they make at face to face meetings with their peers, together with the information they gather at these events.&#xd;<br />The challenges which our sector faces are so many and complex, that no single company can efficiently, or effectively, tackle them alone. AFEMS offers an effective mechanism by which our joint efforts can be coordinated in pursuit of common objectives, to better ensure a positive outcome for our industry.&#xd;<br />The recent, major report on Lead ammunition, prepared in response to Reach Regulation requirements, is a real example of what AFEMS can accomplish to ensure the adoption of proportionate policies in relation to our sector. &#xd;<br />Thanks to its long history and experience AFEMS has an excellent reputation and is, today, regarded as the European association of the sporting ammunition sector, able to fully address its challenges.&#xd;<br />In order to safeguard the collective interests of its members, AFEMS undertakes a range of activities. Working with our members, AFEMS aims to:&#xd;<br />•gather and exchange information on scientific, technical, institutional, environmental and standardisation issues regarding sporting ammunition and related industries;&#xd;<br />•participate in working groups, comprising experts from European industry, to study problems and propose solutions;&#xd;<br />•cooperate with the European Commission during Directive preparatory stages, by being able to provide specific information regarding our industry;&#xd;<br />•submit papers to the EU Parliament representing our industry's position;&#xd;<br />•monitor the work of the Committee of United Nations Working Groups and Experts (Transport of Dangerous Goods);&#xd;<br />•co-operate with CEN (European Committee for Standardization) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) to draft standards to govern our sector;&#xd;<br />establish and maintain working relations with the main European non-governmental organisations safeguarding and developing hunting and sport shooting;&#xd;<br />•foster compatibility between the industry's requirements and the expectations of environmental protection bodies;&#xd;<br />•promote mutual respect, dialogue and shared goals between the hunting and sport shooting community, decision-making bodies and public at large, to improve quality of life and to maximise economic benefits.","acronym":"AFEMS","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Consumer Affairs, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Sport, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Directive 2017/853/EC, Regulation 258/2012, REACH dossier on lead, Working group on Explosives, Council Directive 92/43/EEC","lastUp":"2017-12-20T09:39:44.521+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
