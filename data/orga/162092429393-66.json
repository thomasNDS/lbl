Working at the intersection of business and government, our lawyers have significant EU law experience and a detailed knowledge and understanding of the European institutions. The focus of our work is on legal advice that does not fall within the scope of the register (i.e. advice to clients on legal or administrative proceedings, on compliance with law, on the impact of regulatory changes, and representation in legal proceedings). However, Hogan Lovells also offers to support clients, via representation or mediation, in their participation in the EU's political processes including the provision of tactical or strategic advice and the drafting of advocacy material.","acronym":"Hogan Lovells","interests":"Banking and financial services, Business and Industry, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Trade, Transport","euInitiatives":"The EU policies we follow include competition, life sciences, export control, economic sanctions, customs, trade, technology &amp; media, transport, Digital Single Market, privacy, security and defence, energy, food &amp; environment law.","lastUp":"2020-01-02T14:35:03.585+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":"0-99999"}
