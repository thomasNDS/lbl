Predictable and mutual cooperation is necessary to ensure Norway's access to the EU internal market and regulatory conditions that are on a par with those of other EU and EEA countries. For the past two decades, the EEA agreement has served Norway' s interests in this respect. The EEA Agreement is thus the basis for LO's trade union policies in Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />LO believes that the social dimension of the internal market needs to be reinforced. Ensuring common minimum regulations in the field of labour legislation and preventing social dumping should be highly prioritised tasks. In recent years the trend has been to the opposite; there is a rise in attacks on existing rights and a decrease in new community minimum standards. The financial crisis has compounded difficulties by pressuring domestic wage formation, collective agreements and fundamental trade union rights in many European States.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EEA agreement affects the Norwegian world of work and our society through decisions taken in Brussels. LO demands that the Norwegian government oppose any restriction on the right to use collective means of action, the collective bargaining system and the right to national wage formation. The ILO conventions, Norwegian collective agreements and Norwegian labour legislation must take precedence over community regulations. This precedence needs to be clarified between the signatories to the EEA agreement.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />LO demands that Norway have an active policy towards Europe. Norway must exploit the full scope of the EEA agreement to influence the design of new regulations and their transposition into Norwegian law. The political authorities need to ensure that Norwegian interests are safeguarded. An early-on approach to political processes is the key to influencing the outcomes. It is vital that the government have a good dialogue with the social partners when transposing EU regulations into Norwegian legislation. The right of reservation must be exercised against EU directives that restrict national policies to prevent social dumping or encroach on trade union rights and welfare regimes.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />LO will strive for a closer Nordic political and trade union cooperation. LO has cooperation with and coordinates trade union activities with the Nordic Trade Union Council. The Norwegian government must be an active force in strengthening Norwegian and Nordic interests in Europe through active cooperation with the Nordic countries.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />LO takes part in the design of trade union policies at the European level through our affiliation with the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC). Active involvement in the ETUC is our most important channel for exerting influence on the design and development of the employment, social, education and gender parity policies of Europe and the EU. LO's cooperation with the ETUC will be prioritised and our efforts to defend and further develop trade union rights in the EU and Europe will be intensified.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />LO will play an active role in the EFTA Consultative Committee on workers' rights and the social dimension in EFTA's work on trade agreements, and their work in respect of the EU and EEA cooperation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Trade union and social rights are weak in the newest EU member States and those that have been instituted are under heavy attack. LO will help to strengthen trade union rights and the social dialogue in these countries by means of the Decent Work Fund and tripartite cooperation. The Fund should be maintained in future EEA finance schemes.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />LO will put emphasis on trade union organising, trade union rights and exercising joint trade union influence over developments in the High North/Artic region.","acronym":"LO-Norway","interests":"Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Single market, Trade, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Social Pillar&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Work Life Balance directive&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Access to Social Protection&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Working time Directive&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Implementation of revised Posting of Workers Directive &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EU Youth Guarantee &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Trade agreements&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Platform Economy&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Aviation Package&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Mobility Package/Europe on the Move&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Fourth Railway Package&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Energy Union&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ELA - European Labour Authority&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Brexit and EEA implications","lastUp":"2019-07-18T11:36:48.027+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
