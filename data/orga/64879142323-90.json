Within this framework, the Association's main purpose is to serve the Members and the European chemical industry by generating and aggregating scientific knowledge that fosters the purpose of the Association in critical areas and by offering needs-oriented services and expertise to its Members in, amongst others, regulatory, scientific and technical matters. In view of supporting this main purpose, the Association may, in compliance with the antitrust law, promote, defend and represent with particular emphasis on their scientific, technical, pedagogic, environmental, economic, statistical, legal and structural aspects, all matters of common interest to the European chemical industry, in the widest sense, at European and global level, always endeavouring to add value as a collective compared to individual Member's activities. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In order to realize the aforementioned purpose of international utility, the Association may in particular develop the following activities:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />a) To build a solid scientific knowledge base on chemistry and chemicals in Europe as required to deliver on the vision and foster the purpose of the Association; &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />b) To bring together industry stakeholders in order to exchange information, to develop new understandings, science and knowledge and to foster or facilitate collaborative innovation;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />c) To bring together the competences of Members to deliver on the vision and foster the purpose of the Association; &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />d) To be instrumental in building consensus among Members and between Members and other stakeholders, always complying with antitrust rules and applicable regulations and striving to reach the highest target;   &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />e) To endeavour to create business friendly, science based and positive framework conditions to foster innovation in Europe and strive for a world class European investment environment for safe, innovative and resource efficient chemical products and processes;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />f) To serve as a resource and forum for education, information sharing and networking between the Members; &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />g) To contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to drive forward resource efficiency and sustainability in the chemical industry and the activities of the Association;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />h) To constantly expand and promote Responsible Care;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />i) To secure the \"license to grow\" for chemicals companies in Europe, beyond the \"license to operate\";&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />j) To strive to engage in and shape societal debates in key and focus areas, especially on issues related to risk and new technologies;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />k) To inspire the young generations and promote the benefits of chemistry and STEM skills (science, technology, engineering and mathematics);&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />l) To be the voice of the European Chemical Industry at European and global level by representing the interests of the Members of the Association across Europe and advocating their interests to create the right support and policy frameworks for the chemical industry in Europe and beyond, addressing specifically European policy makers, the European Union institutions and other European regulatory bodies;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />m) To maximise efforts to build the reputation of the chemical industry. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our members embody the different sectors and sub-sectors of the chemical industries which study all questions of specific interests (see list on Cefic website www.cefic.org)","acronym":"Cefic","interests":"Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Consumers, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Here the main different EU policies followed by Cefic:&#xd;<br />1.

Those activities are organised within Cefic via the Cefic Sector Groups, which are dealing with specific substances/products or families of substances/products. There are currently around 70 Cefic Sector groups. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The activities of all the Cefic Sector Groups carried out with the objective of directly or indirectly influencing the formulation or implementation of policy and the decision-making processes of the EU institutions are covered by the registration of Cefic into the EU Transparency Register.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Here the complete list of all the Cefic Sector Groups: http://www.cefic.org/Documents/About-Us/Members/Cefic_Sector_groups.pdf?epslanguage=en&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />For more information about the Cefic Sector Groups, please go to http://www.cefic.org/About-us/How-Cefic-is-organised/ and click on the orange boxes related to the Sector Groups of Cefic.","lastUp":"2019-02-06T14:45:14.100+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
