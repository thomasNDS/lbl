In the ACA framework, the ACA members enhance their capacities and join forces in supporting and ‘doing’ future-oriented and top-quality internationalisation. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ACA is equally a brain-trust, with an impeccable track record in conducting sound research and providing – through its active members and its very knowledgeable and well-linked Secretariat – expert advice on key developments in international higher education to universities, governments and supra-national organisations alike. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />While ACA’s core membership and identity is distinctly European, and its key area of attention is European higher education, the association has an important outreach function, constantly monitoring Europe’s position in global higher education and aiming to shape global debates and developments.","acronym":"ACA","interests":"Business and Industry, Communication, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, External Relations, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Migration and asylum, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"The Academic Cooperation Association (ACA) is a European association engaged in the area of international higher education, through e.g. promoting international cooperation, internationalisation of higher education institutions and systems, conducting research and activity-based projects in Europe and at global level. &#xd;<br />ACA members are national bodies with the same remit, promoting academic exchanges, joint projects and international cooperation in higher education. Many of ACA's members are Erasmus+ agencies and/or EURAXESS contact points.  &#xd;<br />ACA Secretariat, based in Brussels, keeps regular contact with the European institutions through stakeholder meetings, ACA's European Policy Seminars, conferences, commissioned research by the Commission and Parliament and projects supporting EU priorities in higher education and research. &#xd;<br />At the moment, ACA is involved in a number of EU-funded projects and cooperates with EU bodies on different topics:&#xd;<br />- Study in Europe initiative, promoting European higher education in the world (DG EAC, EEAS)&#xd;<br />- 2 science4refugees projects, supporting integration of highly skilled refugees in Europe (DG RTD)&#xd;<br />- Annual advocacy seminars in Brussels (DG EAC) on inclusion, European cooperation in higher education and other topics identified relevant by ACA members and the wider HE community. The seminars always include EU representatives as speakers. &#xd;<br />- On 13-14 June 2019, ACA held a joint seminar with a sister organisation (UNICA) at the European Committee of the Regions on the integration of highly skilled refugees, attracting some 140 participants and featuring EC, EP and CoR representatives as welcome and keynote speakers. https://acaevents.events.idloom.com/greet/pages/programme&#xd;<br />- The upcoming ACA seminar on digitalisation in higher education will also feature EU representatives on the programme: https://acaevents.events.idloom.com/eps2_2019&#xd;<br />ACA is involved in a number of stakeholder consultation groups, namely on inclusion in higher education, Marie-Sklodowska Curie Actions, meetings of national promotion agencies with the European Commission, as well as the Erasmus+ Coalition, a grouping of education and training organisations advocating for the more inclusive and balanced Erasmus+ programme in the next programming period. The Coalition regularly meets with the European Commission and Parliament. &#xd;<br />ACA has conducted several studies for the European Parliament in the past 6-7 years, from a study on university rankings in 2015 (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/563377/IPOL_STU(2015)563377_EN.pdf), a review of the Erasmus+ implementation in 2016 (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2016/585877/IPOL_STU(2016)585877_EN.pdf) to the 2017 study on modernisation of European higher education in response to the EC communication (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/602002/IPOL_STU(2017)602002_EN.pdf); &#xd;<br />-","lastUp":"2019-09-02T15:59:55.071+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
