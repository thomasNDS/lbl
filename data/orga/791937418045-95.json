In the ACA framework, the ACA members enhance their capacities and join forces in supporting and ‘doing’ future-oriented and top-quality internationalisation. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ACA is equally a brain-trust, with an impeccable track record in conducting sound research and providing – through its active members and its very knowledgeable and well-linked Secretariat – expert advice on key developments in international higher education to universities, governments and supra-national organisations alike. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />While ACA’s core membership and identity is distinctly European, and its key area of attention is European higher education, the association has an important outreach function, constantly monitoring Europe’s position in global higher education and aiming to shape global debates and developments.","acronym":"ACA","interests":"Business and Industry, Communication, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, External Relations, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Migration and asylum, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"Council of the European Union (2009), Council conclusions of 12 May 2009 on a strategic framework for European cooperation in education &amp; training (‘ET 2020’) (2009/C 119/02), &#xd;<br />Council of the European Union &amp; European Commission (2012), 2012 Joint Report of the Council &amp; the Commission on the implementation of the Strategic Framework for European cooperation in education &amp; training (ET 2020). ‘Education &amp; Training in a smart, sustainable &amp; inclusive Europe’ (2012/C 70/05), Brussels,&#xd;<br />Council of the European Union &amp; European Commission (2015), 2015 Joint Report of the Council &amp; the Commission on the implementation of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education &amp; training (ET 2020).
