In the ACA framework, the ACA members enhance their capacities and join forces in supporting and ‘doing’ future-oriented and top-quality internationalisation. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ACA is equally a brain-trust, with an impeccable track record in conducting sound research and providing – through its active members and its very knowledgeable and well-linked Secretariat – expert advice on key developments in international higher education to universities, governments and supra-national organisations alike. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />While ACA’s core membership and identity is distinctly European, and its key area of attention is European higher education, the association has an important outreach function, constantly monitoring Europe’s position in global higher education and aiming to shape global debates and developments.","acronym":"ACA","interests":"Business and Industry, Communication, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, External Relations, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Migration and asylum, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"ACA’s strength as an organisation lies on its extensive membership of national-level organisations across Europe and beyond, and on its excellent track record in Europe-wide studies. In their countries, ACA members are involved in a wide range of activities in the field of internationalisation of education, with particular focus on management of exchange programmes, promotion of national education and culture abroad, research and data collection, provision of education-related information and consultation, and formulating policy advice. In addition to its full members, ACA also has a number of associate members. These are national organisations of a similar profile, placed outside of Europe. &#xd;<br />ACA has been involved in a wide range of EU initiatives through providing expertise in the course of EU policy-making processes, as coordinator and partner in European projects in the field of higher education, culture and research (Socrates, Tempus, Erasmus Mundus, Lifelong Learning Programme, Erasmus+, Horizon 2020). ACA has actively participated in policy formulation as a research and advisory body on student and staff mobility in Europe, internationalisation of higher education, English-medium programmes in European higher education, Open Education, etc.&#xd;<br />ACA’s expertise ranges from mobility to many more themes linked to the European higher education discourse and agendas (curricular internationalisation, system-level innovation, access to higher education and services for international students, quality assurance, the role of ICT in fostering knowledge, and the positioning of European higher education globally).&#xd;<br />ACA is currently involved in several projects, among others as partner in the Study in Europe project – global promotion of Europe as a study destination, IMPALA – a capacity-building project with South African universities, MasterMind Europe project which addresses admissions to master’s programme in Europe, etc. &#xd;<br />In 2016, ACA conducted a study for the European Parliament on the mid-term review of Erasmus+ decentralised actions, which was presented at the EP on several occasions. Another similar study is currently underway.","lastUp":"2019-07-10T12:18:17.390+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"700000-799999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
