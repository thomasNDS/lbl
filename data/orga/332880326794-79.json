ASU is open to challenges and changes, adopting the best experience of the world universities, both expanding inter-nationally and serving own country, seeking for continuous improvement and leadership among the best universities in our field.&#xd;<br />The University was originally established as Higher Courses, founded in 1920 in Kaunas, and the Lithuanian University, founded in 1924. In 1924 agronomy and forestry studies were transferred from the Lithuanian University to the Academy of Agriculture, established in Dotnuva in the same year. In 1946 it was transferred to Kaunas, and in 1964 to a special academic campus near the city of Kaunas.&#xd;<br />Following Lithuanian independence the management of the Academy was upgraded, a modern three-level education system (Bachelor, Master and PhD studies) was established, research based studies were developed, and study programs corresponding to market demands were offered. In 1996 the institution was granted a university status and officially named the Lithuanian Agricultural University. &#xd;<br />In 2011 the University was re-named Aleksandras Stulginskis University after the second President of the Republic of Lithuania and significant structural, managerial and status of the University changes were made; at that time the University was transferred from being a budget institution to public institution, and the mission statement was broadened. The revised Mission of the University, approved in late 2011 states:&#xd;<br />WE, UNIVERSITY’S COMMUNITY, WILL ASPIRE TO CREATE AND DISSEMINATE THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND SINCERELY STRIVE FOR SAFE AND HEALTHY FOOD AND FULL-FLEDGED LIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL PEOPLE OF LITHUANIA. &#xd;<br />Our steps to this major aim include:&#xd;<br />1. Training of leaders and development of their ability to create and share their knowledge, precipitance and desire for continuous improvement.&#xd;<br />2. Creation and dissemination of biological, engineering and social tech-nologies, advanced knowledge and experience in sustainable use and development of land, forest and water resources.&#xd;<br />3. Fostering of achievements and long-standing traditions of University activity, building our work on the most important professional and universal values.&#xd;<br />Modern-day ASU is the institution of university education in Lithuania where highly qualified specialists of agriculture, forestry, water management and rural development are trained. Besides the training of agricultural specialists, research in the fields of agriculture, forestry, environmental science, water and land management and social sciences is carried out. University scientists are experts on Lithuanian agricultural policy, National and International programs and projects. They also provide consultations to the farmers in the field of market economy, agricultural production, farm management, environmental measures, rural tourism etc. Scientists of ASU are closely working with national and international private companies.","acronym":"ASU","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"Bendroji žemės ūkio politika, Horizontas 2020, Europa 2020, EU plan for a competitive low-carbon economy by 2050, EU strategy on adaptation to climate change","lastUp":"2018-04-17T12:23:57.124+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
