EMERGENCY provides free, high quality medical and surgical treatment to the victims of war, landmines and poverty. EMERGENCY promotes a culture of peace, solidarity and respect for human rights. EMERGENCY's work around the world is made possible thanks to the help of thousands of volunteers and supporters. EMERGENCY believes that the right to care is a fundamental human right, so EMERGENCY wants a healthcare based on: EQUALITY: Every human being has the right to treatment, regardless of their social background, economic situation, gender, ethnicity, language, religion or opinions. New and better treatments made possible by progress and advances in medical science must be available to all patients, on an equal basis and without discrimination. QUALITY: High-quality healthcare systems must be based on every individual’s needs and follow new advances in medical science. They cannot be steered, organised or defined by those financially invested in the healthcare industry. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: Governments must make the health and wellbeing of their citizens a priority. They must set aside the human and economic resources necessary for this end. The healthcare services that governments and humanitarian organisations provide must be free and available to all. HOW EMERGENCY OPERATES: All EMERGENCY facilities are designed, built and run by specialized international personnel, who provide training for local staff.
