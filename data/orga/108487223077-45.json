Women traditionally have vast experience in the water sector and the crucial role they play in effective and efficient water management is increasingly acknowledged and supported by evidence. Involving both women and men in integrated water resources initiatives leads to better sustainability, governance and efficiency. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Being a diverse network of women’s organizations, WfWP can draw from a magnitude of expertise and knowledge relating to different themes and topics in the broad water-gender-sustainable development nexus. When a specific expertise is needed, globally, regionally or nationally, WfWP calls upon the relevant member to represent WfWP and provide input for that specific occasion.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />WfWP’s approach to seeking solutions at three levels simultaneously:&#xd;<br />At the grassroots level WfWP, through its member organizations and in cooperation with strategic partners, enables local women’s groups to address priority challenges in their communities related to water and sustainable development. Women groups are coached and supported to manage and supervise their own projects, lobby and advocate to influence local agenda’s and to become leaders or agents of change in their constituencies.&#xd;<br />At the national level WfWP capacitates and supports member organizations to effectively contribute to the development and implementation of policies and programs in their regions and countries.&#xd;<br />At the global level WfWP and its member organizations use their collective voice for women in global agenda setting and contribute to international policy development through UN and other global processes. WfWP looks out for improving policies and keeping governments to their commitments.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />​​Member projects and programmes to contribute to equitable access to safe water and sustainable development are at the heart of WfWP. In our projects members focus on the inclusion of women from day one: from decisions about starting a water project/programme, to investments, allocation of means, design, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluations of the programme. Special attention is paid to inclusion of women in water governance. Capacity development both at institutional and individual level remains a crucial aspect in all our projects. Emphasis is placed on empowerment of women and their communities, coaching, and (vocational) training. Regional and national hubs will increasingly support these projects.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Lobby and advocacy is an essential element of WfWP’s work to ensure that decision makers, science and technology take on board local realities. WfWP influences policy by providing members a podium to articulate their opinions in (inter)-national policy processes and main (inter)-national water events. WfWP collaborates with partners and like-minded organisations also outside the water sector to increase its effectiveness.  Lobby messages are derived from real life experiences and lessons learnt.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />WfWP's knowledge exchange and learning platform, along with regional workshops and peer-to-peer support, facilitates members in sharing best practices, lessons learnt and expertise on different themes. It contributes to improved project implementation, and stimulates “out of the box thinking”.","acronym":"WfWP","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Climate Action, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Human Rights to water &amp; sanitation&#xd;<br />Equal Pay&#xd;<br />gender equality III&#xd;<br />EU responses to SDGs/ trans-formative agenda 2030&#xd;<br />EU consensus on development cooperation&#xd;<br />EU processes on next MFF and EDF / NDICI&#xd;<br />Water Framework directive evaluation&#xd;<br />EC/ EU Reference document on water and Development&#xd;<br />implementation water diplomacy&#xd;<br />EU Council conclusions on water diplomacy (EEAS)","lastUp":"2019-10-26T12:21:54.287+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
