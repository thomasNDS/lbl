HepBCPPA, together with all  the other main advocacy groups in the field of hepatitis,  aims to politically advance the fight against viral hepatitis B and C in Europe, in line with the WHO Global Health Sector Strategy, the WHO Europe Action Plan and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.&#xd;<br />These activities may include working with the major stakeholders in the field of these diseases, interacting with EU and national institutions, commissioning studies, disseminating into the public domain material on the burden of these diseases, organising national and international conferences, high-level meetings and summits and assisting regulators and other stakeholders in the implementation of viral hepatitis programmes. Since 2016, HepBCPPA is one of the main advocates of the elimination of hepatitis C in Europe by 2030 having launched Europe’s first Hepatitis C Elimination Manifesto in 2016 and a call to action entitled “Securing Sustainable Funding for Hepatitis C Elimination Plans” in June 2018.","acronym":"HepBCPPA","interests":"Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health","euInitiatives":"Public Health&#xd;<br />HepBCPPA, together wih the other main advocacy groups in the field of hepatitis, ACHIEVE (Associations Collaborating on Hepatitis to Immunise and Eliminate the Viruses in Europe) aims to politically advance the fight against viral hepatitis B and C in Europe, in line with the WHO Global Health Sector Strategy, the WHO Europe Action Plan and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.&#xd;<br />Hepatitis B and C Public Policy Association warmly welcomes the adoption of the European Parliament Resolution on the EU’s response to HIV/ AIDS, TB and Hepatitis C of 6th July 2017.&#xd;<br />This resolution calls on the Commission and Member States to develop a comprehensive EU Policy Framework addressing HIV/ AIDS, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis. It also calls on the Commission, under the direction of the ECDC, to launch a multidisciplinary plan, in coordination with Member States, which will standardize screening, testing and treatment protocols, and which will eradicate hepatitis C by 2030.&#xd;<br />HepBCPPA in 2019 will monitor the progress following this resolution.&#xd;<br />We hope that future Council Presidencies, such as the upcoming Council Presidency Trio of Romania, Finland and Croatia, will respond to the call of the European Parliament by adopting Council Conclusions on the topic. These Conclusions should mandate the European Commission to develop the pending EU Policy Framework on HIV/ Aids, Tuberculosis and Viral Hepatitis, and give guidance on how to expand the Dublin Declaration on HIV/ Aids in EU and neighbouring countries to include hepatitis and TB. This way, effective monitoring of viral hepatitis will be ensured throughout Europe, allowing decision-makers in public health to track progress on achieving the WHO elimination target by 2030.","lastUp":"2020-01-14T08:57:16.938+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
