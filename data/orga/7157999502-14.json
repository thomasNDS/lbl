IETA has established a number of Working Groups that meet regularly and organise events on topics like emissions trading, technical aspects of carbon markets, registry accounts and monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV).&#xd;<br />IETA continues to map down initiatives that work in developing components of the carbon markets and help create an effective and well functioning carbon market. &#xd;<br />- Promote market mechanisms and participation in carbon markets. IETA continues to promote market mechanisms and trading as the solution to the business community to minimize costs effectively.  &#xd;<br />- Development of a global carbon market. A critical element in IETA's work remains the linking of trading regimes among Annex I countires, and its significance for the GHG market. &#xd;<br />- Capacity Building, by developing and delivering courses on carbon markets, the effective functioning of an emissions trading system and the monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) component.","acronym":"IETA","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment","euInitiatives":"- EU ETS Phase 4 implementing acts (Directive 2018/410)&#xd;<br />- Innovation Fund and Modernisation Fund &#xd;<br />- EU's long term decarbonisation strategy &#xd;<br />- Carbon leakage provisions and free allocation for Phase 4&#xd;<br />- Aviation under the EU ETS and the work of the EU and CORSIA&#xd;<br />- EU's NDC and participation in international climate negotiations with a special focus on the implementation of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement","lastUp":"2018-09-19T12:06:51.391+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
