For years World Animal Protection have experience working with stakeholders at different levels, including all EU Institutions, the World Organisation for Animal Health OIE and key United Nations agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation. We work with several governments and regional political blocks such as ASEAN, the African Union and of course the European Union. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Many of our supporters and members are based in Europe, including The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and the UK, where our International office is based. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our four programme areas define our main campaigns, which are aligned with our strategic approach. We work with animals in farming, animals in communities (mainly stray dog populations), animals in the wild and animals affected by disasters. Our approach combines education and mobilisation efforts, catalysing and up-scaling sustainable solutions and having a strong advocacy stream of work. We base our work on robust evidence and, where needed, strong science, while ensuring that we contribute to global debates on public health, agricultural systems, environment and sustainable economies.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Consumers, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"- EU Animal Welfare Strategy 2012-2015&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Animal welfare standards &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Animal welfare indicators&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- International trade and goods movement &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Animal health (including Animal health strategy 2007-2013) &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Regulations, directives and further normativity on farmed animals, companion animals, wild animals (particularly on trade and captivity), use of animals in scientific research and working animals &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Animal sentience, particularly development of Article 13 of the Treaty of Lisbon&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Animal protection in the framework of the negotiation of Article 50 for the United Kingdom.","lastUp":"2019-04-10T15:40:08.589+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
