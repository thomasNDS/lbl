It has 4 delegations across Portugal and operates in around 12 municipalities/regions of Portugal. Our main goal is to improve the quality-of-life of people living with HIV and to contribute to the eradication of HIV as well as, other sexual transmitted infections and hepatitis. To achieve these goals, ABRAÇO has four pillars of intervention: psychosocial support (e.g. home-care programs, social cafeteria, psychological support as well as psychotherapy, employment programs, residential homes, among others), clinical (e.g. HIV; hepatitis and other STI's screening, STI consultations and a dental office), training and research (e.g. training other health or social professionals, research in behavioural, public health and epidemiological sciences), prevention (e.g. school prevention programs, condoms and info material, awareness campaigns, among others). Throughout our work, we focus our approach on the end-user, involving them in the process as well as, advocating for their rights.","acronym":"ABRAÇO","interests":"Public Health","euInitiatives":"HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis as well as other STI's. &#xd;<br />Public Health, Communicable diseases.","lastUp":"2018-09-21T12:25:40.157+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
