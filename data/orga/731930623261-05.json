It represents 60+ member organisations that work with 20,000 digital competence centres providing access &amp; training to 2+ million people in Europe every year. We aim to enable the 43% Europeans without basic digital skills to exploit the opportunities created by digital transformation.&#xd;<br />Our members are non-profit organisations (ICT community centres, NGOs, public libraries, universities, foundations, etc.) in the field of non-formal education providing access to Internet &amp; ICT tools, as well as digital trainings, certification and opportunities for everyone. Since they are low-threshold places with free or very low-cost trainings, they are particularly fit to serve disadvantaged groups such as unemployed young people, people in less advantageous social and economic situation, elderly people, migrants, etc. However, they provide services to all target groups. &#xd;<br />ALL DIGITAL supports its members by fostering knowledge sharing &amp; collaboration and by representing their interest to the EU.&#xd;<br />Our activities include:&#xd;<br />- developing and promoting innovative training methodologies &amp; certifications; &#xd;<br />- facilitating partnerships among members &amp; stakeholders;&#xd;<br />- organising events and awareness raising campaigns like ALL DIGITAL Summit and ALL DIGITAL Week (ex. Get Online Week); &#xd;<br />- ALL DIGITAL Awards; &#xd;<br />- projects application and implementation;&#xd;<br />- advocacy on the importance of digital skills and the key role of organisations such as our members in helping citizens acquire those skills;&#xd;<br />- research. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Most of the activities we undertake are creating and promoting innovative solutions and good practices in the field of digital skills and digital inclusion. To this end, we engage with a variety of stakeholders within the non-formal education and e-skills training fields: European associations and member organisations, civil society networks, ICT private companies and the European Institutions. Together with stakeholders on the European level, we succeed in understanding and rethinking digital inclusion and issues affecting it.","acronym":"ALL DIGITAL","interests":"Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Research and innovation, Youth","euInitiatives":"We follow and contribute to EU policy in the fields of education and skills, employment, social &amp; economic inclusion, social innovation, Digital Single Market, e.g. by policy papers &amp; targeted communication.&#xd;<br />As members of the Lifelong Learning Platform (LLLP) we cooperate with other civil society organisations in education and training on joint positions regarding mainstreaming digital skills, making Erasmus+ more effective and articulating joint messages to the EU institutions.
