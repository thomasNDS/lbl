KAN itself is not a standardization body; its resolutions on OH&amp;S and standardization take the form of recommendations which are based on as broad a consensus as possible of all the relevant institutions involved in OH&amp;S.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />KAN focuses on&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- formulating fundamental OH&amp;S positions on important issues of the standardization process,&#xd;<br />- assessing the content of standards to determine whether they meet the OH&amp;S requirements from the German point of view and comply with the protection goals specified in European directives,&#xd;<br />- exerting influence on standardization programmes and mandates (mandates are issued by the European Commission to the private CEN/CENELEC standards bodies),&#xd;<br />- checking whether there is a need for standardization from the point of view of OH&amp;S,&#xd;<br />- obtaining and providing or distributing information on standardization work for the OH&amp;S experts.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Implementation&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The KAN aims its recommendations and opinions&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- mainly directly on the standardization level at DIN and its standards committees if individual national, European or international standardization projects are concerned;&#xd;<br />- on the political level at the Federal Government if fundamental issues of standardization, the interpretation of directives and the mandating of standardization projects are concerned. The Government passes them on to the European Commission.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In addition, the national associations represented by KAN contribute their views to the standardization debate through their European partner organizations.","acronym":"KAN","interests":"Business and Industry, Consumers, Employment and Social Affairs, Single market","euInitiatives":"Functioning of NLF directives and regulations, especially new format for standardisation requests&#xd;<br />Revision of Directive 2006/42/EC (Safety of Machinery)&#xd;<br />Revision of individual Directives within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC, e.g. Directive 90/270/EEC and Directive 89/654/EWG&#xd;<br />Guideline on safety signs&#xd;<br />Cyber Security Act&#xd;<br />Single Market Strategy","lastUp":"2020-01-07T11:17:58.396+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
