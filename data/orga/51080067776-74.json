Our strength lies in our extensive membership and we are proud to represent more than 60 organisations from 46 countries covering geographical Europe. We deliver benefits for each regardless of the geographical, technical, political, organisational, linguistic and business parameters in which they work.  &#xd;<br />As the official bodies responsible for national cadastre, land registration, geodetic surveying and mapping activities in Europe, EuroGeographics’ members fulfil an essential role providing definitive and detailed geospatial information. As their membership association, EuroGeographics is committed to supporting them as they improve access to their rich source of data.&#xd;<br />EuroGeographics supports the public good by:&#xd;<br />• Representing members’ interests;&#xd;<br />• Maintaining networks that help members improve their capabilities and role; and&#xd;<br />• Facilitating access to and use of geospatial data and services from these official national sources. &#xd;<br />We believe in a society empowered by the use of our members’ authoritative geospatial data and services, and we are committed to representing their interests in the European institutions and internationally to ensure that their roles, capabilities and concerns are understood. Our aim is always to provide positive contributions to those areas of policy development where we, and our members, have a track record, significant expertise and a legitimate interest. This enables us to not only demonstrate and grow our relevance and effectiveness, but also helps members stay connected with policy developments and legislative programmes. &#xd;<br />Many European institutions rely on European datasets created from our members national information to inform key decisions, and we believe that they should have one agreed geospatial policy, that takes into account the role of national mapping, cadastral and land registry authorities, for informing policy development and legislation.&#xd;<br />EuroGeographics pursues activities of a not-for-profit nature and of international character in accordance with the title III of the Belgian law of 27 June, 1921 on non-profit organisations, non-profit international organisations and foundations. &#xd;<br /> Level of interests represented: &#xd;<br />•\tEuropean&#xd;<br />•\tglobal&#xd;<br />•\tnational&#xd;<br />•\tregional/local","acronym":"","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Institutional affairs, Single market, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Digital Single Market:&#xd;<br />Our members have an interest in the Digital Single Market, in particular the opening up of public data for reuse. We have contributed to the legal debate on the Public Sector Information Directive recast by submitting EuroGeographics Information paper in September 2018. Our goal is to realise a sustainable public-sector information framework that accommodates the contributions of all our members to maximise the benefits for European society.&#xd;<br />The European Space programme:&#xd;<br />EuroGeographics actively supports the Copernicus component of the European Space Programme and is interested in further integration of Earth Observation and reference data. We believe it must make full use of member states’ existing reference data to avoid duplication and wasted resources. Our aim is to make more national authoritative geospatial information available, and we contributed to the legal debate by submitting the Information paper in November 2018.&#xd;<br />On the 27th January we submitted our online replies to Public Consultation of the European GNSS Agency on the Integrity &amp; Reliability of Digital Maps for Connected and Automated Driving&#xd;<br />Cadastral issues related to policy, such as the e-Justice portal:&#xd;<br />By tracking EU initiatives, legal and non-legal developments in the respective and adjoining areas, we want to support our members in identifying the future role of cadastre, presenting its capacities and its indispensability to a wide range of community policies.&#xd;<br />Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)&#xd;<br />Intellectual Property Rights – patents, trademarks, design rights and copyright – are of great interest to our members, not only to encourage the creation of a variety of intellectual goods but also to ensure economic incentive for private sector enterprises – in particular SMEs - for their creation. Some of our members partially or largely depend on income from licencing fees from the market.&#xd;<br />The European Spatial Data Infrastructure (INSPIRE)&#xd;<br />Our members have made significant efforts to implement the INSPIRE Directive by harmonising their authoritative data on the INSPIRE themes. Implementing INSPIRE, however is not easy, and whilst the Directive most certainly provides leverage for opening up access to sources of authoritative geospatial information, it has not led to full harmonisation, or usage of such data. There are also a number of European policies that do not yet take INSPIRE into account and there is still more to do to ensure the delivery of operational cross-border data and pan-European services. Our members have worked, with the support of EC funds, to advance harmonisation beyond INSPIRE.","lastUp":"2019-06-06T13:36:37.532+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
