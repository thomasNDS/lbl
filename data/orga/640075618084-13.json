JA Worldwide (www.jaworldwide.org) is one of the world’s largest NGO’s offering such programs. Over 10 million students in 2018 participated JA programs in 100+ countries around the world. JA serves its network of member organizations, called “Member Nations” by sharing know-how and development expertise as well as offering services and networking. The programmes offered by each Member Nation are designed to bring together local businesspeople and schools in a variety of ways. For example, businesspeople volunteer their time to help teach the programs in local classrooms. The programme content focuses on economic literacy, business skills, enterprise and entrepreneurship, personal and career development, and ethics or social economics. Member Nations are financed by local businesses and other agencies/institutions which may also serve on the local board of directors. JA Europe www.jaeurope.org is the European arm of JA Worldwide. Today there are 40 European countries offering JA programs (approximately 4 million students in 2018). It is the role of JA Europe to facilitate the growth and development of European Member Nations.","acronym":"JA Europe","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Youth","euInitiatives":"1.
