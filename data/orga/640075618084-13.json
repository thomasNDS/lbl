Its purpose is to inspire and prepare young people to succeed in a global economy. It is a pan-European network of national not-for profit organisations dedicated to teaching as many young people as possible, as early as possible, about the world of enterprise and entrepreneurship. &#xd;<br />The European headquarters are in Brussels, with a team of 13. The main focus for the JA Europe Brussels office is to serve and support the network, represent the network towards the EU institutions, collaborate on policy issues, on content development and on stakeholder outreach.  The network collects participation data on a large scale across Europe and, increasingly, invests in multilateral impact assessment tools. &#xd;<br />Funded by its members, businesses, institutions, foundations and individuals, JA brings the public and private sectors together to provide young people in primary and secondary schools and early university with high-quality education programmes to teach them about enterprise, entrepreneurship, business and economics in a practical way. &#xd;<br />The JA Company Programme, for example, has been recognised as a ‘Best Practice in Entrepreneurship Education’. In total 317,974 students, 15,141 number of teachers in 8,156 number of schools were involved in 2015-2016. JA Europe and its members are constantly developing and improving the program based on both input from Ministries and schools, and learning from research and field studies. &#xd;<br />The JA network has always promoted entrepreneurship education at all school levels, believing that these competences progress and evolve over time. JA is about “learning-by-doing” activities that foster innovative thinking and the improvement of work and life skills. Students work closely with business people as mentors and interact with the community through their own enterprises. In 2015-2016, in 40 countries, JA organizations reached 3.5 million students in with support from 122,348 teachers and 152,595 business volunteers.","acronym":"JA Europe","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Youth","euInitiatives":"1.
