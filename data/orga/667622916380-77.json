Il Telefono Azzurro ONLUS is a non-profit organisation founded on June 1987 to promote and protect children’s rights. Over the last 30 years, Telefono Azzurro has grown to become a state-wide point of reference for children and adolescents in distress or in situations of risk. We are deeply committed to advocating for children’s rights, as well as promoting a child-centred culture on a transnational scale. To achieve these goals, we work closely with local, national and international institutions and organisations. Telefono Azzurro can rely on a dedicated and qualified team of experts from a variety of fields, such as psychologists, psychiatrists and social assistants, as well as attorneys and law analysts working in our branch offices.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our core action is our telephone counselling service. Our national toll-free helpline is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to listen and help children and adolescents in need. In February 2003, Telefono Azzurro was entrusted to manage the pilot phase of the 114 Childhood Emergency Hotline, resulting from of an agreement between the Ministers for Communication, Equal Opportunities, Work and Social Policies. Furthermore, after signing the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of the Interior in May 2009, Telefono Azzurro has been also managing the 116 000 hotline for missing children. We also promote on-the-ground initiatives, such as the Emergency Team programme: set up as a pilot project in Treviso, the Emergency Team relies on the action of trained professionals and social service agencies, involved 24 hours a day, 365 days a year in situations where children suffer or witness abuse, may it be domestic violence, prostitution, or delinquency.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Telefono Azzurro has also been implementing school workshops and awareness-raising campaigns to prevent and fight bullying and cyberbullying. We promote a holistic approach, that actively involves students (trough peer-to-peer education) teachers and families, and relies on the support of a specialized staff of psychologist and educators. Our training courses are tailored for students, teachers, and parents, and focus on effective actions to identify and prevent bullying. Students of primary and secondary schools – bullies, victims and bystanders – are targeted with a wide array of training in social skills and are helped to increase their self-disclosure and empathy skills. The main objective is to create a school-wide environment that recognises, discourages and effectively responds to bullying. We are engaged in developing epidemiological surveys on bullying and cyberbullying, and interviewing nationally representative samples of school students.  The statistics and data provided by the helpline 196 96 also contribute to give an overview and a deep understanding of bullying and cyberbullying in Italy.","acronym":"","interests":"Borders and Security, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Public Health, Research and innovation, Sport, Youth","euInitiatives":"SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus is pro-actively involved in several European and International Networks, such as Missing Children Europe (MCE), The EU network of Safer Internet Centres (INSAFE), Child Helpline International (CHI), International Association of Internet Hotlines (INHOPE), International Member of Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC), and Internet Watch Foundation, EC-supported network helping victims of child sexual abuse worldwide by identifying and removing online images and videos.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As part of the main EU networks listed below, SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus is strongly committed and proactively involved in monitoring and influencing the development, and the implementation of those policies and legislative mechanisms which are described in the following paragraphs.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />• SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus, is part of the board of Missing Children Europe (MCE), the European Federation for Missing and Exploited Children.

Insafe is funded by the Safer Internet Programme of the European Union. Every national Centre implements awareness and educational campaigns, runs a helpline, and works closely with youth to ensure an evidence-based, multi-stakeholder approach to creating a better internet. The mission of the Insafe cooperation network is to empower children and young people to use the internet, as well as other online and mobile technologies, positively, safely and effectively. SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus is the helpline and hotline coordinator of the EU initiative “Safer Internet Centre Italy”. Within this context, SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus is particularly interested in the development of the EU regulatory framework for e-Communications, as well as closely monitoring the implementation of the Digital Agenda for Europe, especially those policies focusing on child protection (e.g. Art.8 GDPR). In addition, we have a strong interest toward monitoring the implementation of the EU directive on the fight against child sexual abuse material, sexual abuse and exploitation of minors, as well as other future policy development on this subject. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />• INHOPE – Inhope is an international network gathering 51 hotlines in 45 countries worldwide, committed to eradicate child sexual abuse from the Internet. As one of INHOPE hotlines, SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus offers the public a way of anonymously reporting Internet material including child sexual abuse material they suspect to be illegal. We ensure a follow-up to the reports we receive and contact, where necessary, the relevant law enforcement authorities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />• In order to better monitor and influence the development of EU policy-making on those areas having a potential impact on children’s wellbeing at EU level, SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus is about to establish a Brussels Office.","lastUp":"2019-03-18T20:11:05.506+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
