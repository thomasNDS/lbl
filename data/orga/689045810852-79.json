As the plant-based food category has grown in size but also in diversity, ENSA too has followed the market evolution to become the plant-based foods association. Our members produce plant-based alternatives to dairy and meat, including drinks (based on soy, rice, oats, almond, coconut etc), alternatives to other dairy products (alternatives to yogurt, desserts, creams, ice creams, margarine, cheese) and meat alternatives (tofu, tempeh, seitan, burgers, ready meals etc). Since its establishment in 2003, ENSA has been raising awareness about the role of a plant-based diet in moving towards more sustainable food production and consumption patterns.","acronym":"ENSA","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Consumers, Environment, Food Safety, Public Health, Taxation","euInitiatives":"The main focus areas of ENSA in EU public affairs are: health and nutrition, labelling, agriculture (protein), sustainable development, environment and taxation.","lastUp":"2019-02-27T13:13:20.555+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
