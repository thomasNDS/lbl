PICUM also seeks dialogue with organisations and networks with similar concerns in other parts of the world.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />PICUM provides a direct link between the grassroots level, where undocumented migrants' experience is most visible, and the European level, where policies relating to them are deliberated. PICUM reports on issues regarding undocumented migrants through its members’ experiences and simultaneously monitors developments within the European institutions. This approach mainstreams undocumented migrants' concerns into key policy debates, ensures PICUM’s network is well informed of the EU agenda and develops their capacity to engage in the realisation of just and fair strategies for undocumented migrants.","acronym":"PICUM","interests":"Borders and Security, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Public Health, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"EU MIGRATION AGENDA &#xd;<br />Promote the implementation of migration policies and practices that reduce vulnerabilities and improve social inclusion of people at risk of expulsion due to their precarious migration status.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Together with governments, the Commission and national NGOs, design and implement pilot initiatives that help resolve people’s immigration status while remaining in the community, without resorting to detention which causes social exclusion and harm in the short and long term.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Gather data and best practices to advocate for returns’ procedures that aim to improve the well-being and future outlook of persons and increase the sustainability of return by employing quality legal and social assistance throughout the process. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ACCESS TO JUSTICE&#xd;<br />Support implementation of the EU Victims' Directive, particularly with regards to its application to undocumented victims of crime.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Promote greater awareness among policymakers, the public, and officials responsible for supporting victims, of the rights of victims who are undocumented, and how to effectively implement those rights, as defined and required by EU and international law.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />REDUCING HEALTH INEQUALITIES IN THE EU&#xd;<br />Increases understanding and awareness of the impact of policies outside of the health sector on migrants’ safety and health, the relationship between residence status and social exclusion, and of the potential to address social determinants of health by integrating a rights- and health-based perspective across areas of EU policymaking.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />INVESTING IN CHILDREN&#xd;<br />Coordinates joint advocacy to advance policies and practices that address child poverty and social exclusion by embedding child rights and the 3 pillar approach of Investing in Children Recommendation. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />FAIR WORKING CONDITIONS&#xd;<br />Promote mechanisms that enable all workers regardless of status to enjoy fair, safe and secure working conditions, file a complaint and access remedies in cases of exploitation (Chapter II EPSR and SDGs 8.7 &amp; 8.8). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Address how the prioritisation of immigration enforcement over the enforcement of labour standards makes undocumented workers zero-risk victims for exploitation, resulting in unfair competition and social dumping as well as in-work poverty and social exclusion of workers and their families. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EUROPEAN PILLAR OF SOCIAL RIGHTS&#xd;<br />PICUM serves as a vital bridge between the EU’s social agenda and migration agenda, bringing the realities of migrants into the social inclusion agenda, while also mainstreaming concerns regarding employment, health, children, access to services and social cohesion into the migration policy debate. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Working to advance the social rights of migrants facing de-facto discrimination and exclusion, PICUM works to ensure that EU priorities on migration do not compromise the EU2020 objectives on quality and sustainable employment, adequate and decent social protection, combating poverty and social exclusion, and improving working conditions.","lastUp":"2019-06-26T13:59:37.576+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1000000-1249999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
