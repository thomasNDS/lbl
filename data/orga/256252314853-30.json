The organisation is funded by contributions of our members that are calculated based on pupils numbers in the member countries. VISION: Education enabling all children to holistically unfold their unique potential throughout their lifelong personal and professional development. MISSION: Supporting genuine Steiner Waldorf education and promoting freedom in education in Europe. PRIORITIES: To implement our mission, we promote freedom in education and school autonomy. The provision of genuine Steiner Waldorf education tailored to local needs is best achieved if the following conditions are met: 1) Freedom of curriculum: National associations and local schools can define and fully implement their own school curricula; 2) The freedom of parental school choice as described in Article 14, Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is granted Europe wide; 3) Full public funding for independent non-profit schools is granted Europe wide to realize the right of parental school choice, irrespective of financial means; 4) Pluralism in assessment is a reality and Waldorf schools may develop and provide their own, state-recognised diploma. Standardised and centralised tests are replaced with individualised assessment; 5) Age-appropriate ICT and media pedagogy: Our schools can provide their own ICT and media pedagogy based on our development-oriented approach.","acronym":"ECSWE","interests":"Culture, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Institutional affairs","euInitiatives":"- European Education Area including: Proposal for a COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION on promoting automatic mutual recognition of higher education and upper secondary education diplomas and the outcomes of learning periods abroad&#xd;<br />COM/2018/270 final - 2018/0126 (NLE)&#xd;<br />- Negotiations on the INI - Own-initiative procedure Education in the digital era: challenges, opportunities and lessons for EU policy design (CULT Committee)&#xd;<br />- General work of the CULT Committee&#xd;<br />- General work of the EMPL Committee","lastUp":"2019-09-04T14:23:58.115+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
