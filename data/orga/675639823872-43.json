It aims are &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />I. to co-ordinate actions related to primatology between the different European societies including&#xd;<br />A. the circulation of information between the different national societies and groups in Europe. Folia Primatologica, published by Karger S.A., Basel, is the official publication of the Federation.&#xd;<br />B. meetings of the the national societies, specialist groups and workshops, scientific activities, research and educational projects related to primatology&#xd;<br />II. to promote national management of captive primates and to make studies on primates available to a maximum of students and researchers&#xd;<br />III. to participate through the European Commission on decisions relevant to primate use in captive research&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Currently 9 European countries are affiliated to the EFP: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom. &#xd;<br />The EFP groups people involved in fundamental non-invasive and invasive research, applied biomedical research and zoo management. This accounts for more than 1500 scientists, graduate students and zoo managers. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The aims of all affiliated societies or groups are identical to those of the International Primatological Society (IPS), i.e. to encourage all areas of non-human primatological scientific research, to facilitate cooperation among scientists of all nationalities engaged in primate research, and to promote the conservation of all primate species. &#xd;<br />Protection of captive primates is one of the most important aims of the EFP, practically this means the improvement of the well-being of primates. &#xd;<br />Therefore the EFP intends to promote the dialogue with all people involved in primatology and to promote studies providing scientific evidence on primate welfare issues. &#xd;<br />The EFP will strive to promote the implementation of the \"International Primatological Society Guidelines for the acquisition, care, and breeding of non-human primates\".&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EFP considers its independence from private interests as necessary for its scientific expertise. Consequently the EFP will not sponsor any activities related to private commercial interests. &#xd;<br />However, the EFP provides the scientific experience for all people and organizations interested whenever non-human primates are affected.","acronym":"EFP","interests":"Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"The EFP participates to the work of the Expert Working Groups (DG Environment), concerning the implementation of the Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals utilised in scientific procedures","lastUp":"2018-09-20T09:54:41.651+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
