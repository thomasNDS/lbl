Our name comes from the academic journal «Antigone», founded by (among others) Massimo Cacciari, Stefano Rodotà and Rossana Rossanda, and our motto “per i diritti e le garanzie nel sistema penale” (for rights and guarantees in the penal system) summons up our mission. Our supporters are magistrates, workers in the penitentiary system, lawyers, researchers, parliamentarians, teachers and ordinary citizens interested in criminal justice.&#xd;<br />We carry out many activities including raising awareness on public opinion and facilitate debates on the Italian penal system through campaigns, education, media, publications, and the academic journal “Antigone”. We conduct many studies and researches on penal and penitentiary issues, and cooperate in writing draft laws. In 1998, when Antigone received from the Ministry of Justice a special authorization to visit prisons with the same power that the law gives to parliamentarians, we established an Observatory on Italian prisons involving around 50 people. Since then every year our Observatory publishes a Report on Italian penitentiary system. We also created a prison Ombudsman which collects complaints from prisons and police stations and mediates with the Administration in order to solve specific problems. Furthermore, our lawyers and physicians operate in some Italian prisons giving suggestions and monitoring life conditions. We carry out investigations about ill-treatments and Antigone is sometimes formally involved in the related trials. Moreover we created \"Jailhouse Rock\", a weekly radio broadcast on music and prisons authors. We are a national reference for the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) and we also lead a European Prison Observatory involving nine European Countries and funded by the European Commission.","acronym":"","interests":"Justice and Fundamental Rights","euInitiatives":"Antigone is involved in several research projects funded by European Commission.
