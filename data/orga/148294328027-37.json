Each Enerkem waste-to-biofuels and chemicals facility, such as the Enerkem Alberta Biofuels facility in Edmonton, creates high quality green jobs and brings value to communities and waste-generating industries, while helping solve some of today’s most pressing environmental issues. Enerkem facilities help diversify the energy mix and make greener everyday products while offering a sustainable and economical alternative to landfilling, incineration and traditional fuels and chemicals.
