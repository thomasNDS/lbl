They can tackle society’s biggest problems at the root, lay a foundation for change and play a crucial part in making the global development agenda a reality for all. That is why we want to help institutions and governments across Europe and Africa create policies that work. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our independent policy experts contribute sharp analysis, thorough research and fresh ideas. But making policies work requires stepping off the sidelines too. It means working closely with the people who create, implement and are impacted by policies. We bring different groups around the table, smooth the way for debate and make sure that everyone’s voice is heard. We provide advice and training and design practical solutions together. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We have over thirty years of experience in development policy and international cooperation and know the African and European institutions inside out. Our focus is on EU foreign policy and European and African policies related to conflict, migration, governance, food security, regional integration, business, finance and trade.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our partners include officials from government ministries and institutions, international organisations, think tanks and academia, as well as social and economic actors from Africa, Europe and beyond.","acronym":"ECDPM","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Culture, Economy, finance and the euro, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Research and innovation, Taxation, Trade, Youth","euInitiatives":"Joint Africa-Europe Strategy (JAES), Cotonou Agreement, 2030 Agenda, EU Global Strategy, EU consensus on development, EU neighbourhood, Policy coherence for development, Multiannual Financial Framework,  Joint programming, financing of the African Peace Facility, EU Common Security and Defense Policy, EU trust funds, European Investment Plan, Trade and investment policy, Economic Partnership Agreements, Private sector engagement, Citizens and civil society empowerment, regional integration, food security and nutrition policy,  migration compacts and Valetta action plan, Financing for sustainable development, etc.","lastUp":"2019-09-17T15:58:46.984+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"7000000-7249999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
