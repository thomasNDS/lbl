We focus on tackling the most systematic and widespread human rights violations faced by persons with mental disabilities under three campaigns:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1. \"I'm a Person\" - challenging outdated systems of guardianship and substitute decision-making for persons with disabilities, calling for their replacement with systems of support which enable people to take control over their lives, exercise their autonomy, and take part in political and public life.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. \"Schools for All\" - tackling the denial of education for children with mental disabilities and the problem of segregated education, instead promoting the right to high quality and inclusive education for all children with disabilities along with their peers in common learning environments.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />3. \"My Home, My Choice\" - campaigning against the segregation and institutionalisation of persons with disabilities and the abuses that take place behind closed doors, instead advocating for the the necessary support for people to live independently in the community.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Validity holds special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), participatory status with the Council of Europe, and has a pending application for observer status with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR).","acronym":"Validity Foundation","interests":"Budget, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, European Neighbourhood Policy, External Relations, Fraud prevention, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Youth","euInitiatives":"Validity has been engaged with numerous EU initiatives, policies and legislative files, including:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- The cohesion policy, particularly as this relates to social inclusion of persons with disabilities and investments in social infrastructure&#xd;<br />- The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU as well as the Social Pillar, particularly as these promote the integration of persons with disabilities in society&#xd;<br />- Justice Programme - we have coordinated a number of initiatives co-financed by this programme focused on access to justice for children and adults with disabilities, training for lawyers and allied professionals&#xd;<br />- REC Programme - we have also coordinated a number of initiatives co-financed by this programme focused on the fundamental rights of children and adults with disabilities","lastUp":"2019-10-03T13:27:27.682+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
