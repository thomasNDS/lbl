CERIC-ERIC shall provide, through an international access and peer review system, free open access based on merit and on available resources, and optimum use of resources and know-how available, upon proposal by the Members.&#xd;<br />CERIC-ERIC may carry out limited economic activities, provided that they are closely related to its principal task and that they do not jeopardise the achievement thereof.&#xd;<br />In order to achieve its objectives, CERIC-ERIC shall in particular: (a) exploit the full scientific potential of the Central European Area in the synchrotron light and other microscopic probes for analytical and modification techniques, notably for materials preparation and characterisation, structural investigations and imaging in Life Sciences, Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Cultural Heritage, Environment and Materials Sciences. This shall be achieved by collaborating closely with user communities, by developing and making available a suite of complementary sources and instruments, efficient service and optimum conditions for users and by outreaching activities for new potential users; (b) offer free open access to users selected by international peer review on the basis of quality. This approach shall be implemented to sustain in the participating Members the capability of improving the value, quality and effectiveness of their research communities in an international cooperation/competition approach; (c) make optimum use of resources and know-how by coordinating research and development of relevant technologies, by promoting and coordinating joint training of scientific and technical personnel and young researchers, and by collaborating with neighbouring communities and industry; (d) develop a common strategy and policy for intellectual property and know-how protection and exploitation, fostering the support to industrial developments and users; (e) ensure an efficient internal and external communication, coordinating promotion, outreach and marketing activities; (f) apply for funding.","acronym":"CERIC-ERIC","interests":"Business and Industry, Communication, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, International co-operation and development, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"H2020-INFRADEV-2016-1 - ACCELERATE  Project (731112)&#xd;<br />H2020-INFRADEV-2016-2 - E-RIHS Project (739503)&#xd;<br />ERDF &#xd;<br />ESIF&#xd;<br />H2020-INFRAEOSC-04-2018 - PANOSC Project (823852)&#xd;<br />H2020-INFRASUPP 2018-2020-ERIC Forum Project (823798)","lastUp":"2019-02-27T16:14:37.402+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1000000-1249999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
