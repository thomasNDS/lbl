It is made up of 43 European networks active in education and training in order to build a citizen's voice on lifelong learning issues and to propose concrete solutions based on the expertise, the competencies and the experience of its networks' experts and practitioners.&#xd;<br />LLLP is a tool to promote a holistic vision of lifelong learning, from cradle to grave, that is not limited to formal education but integrates non-formal and informal learning. By bringing together actors from all sectors and levels of education and training, LLLP contributes to an increased flexibility between systems. By encouraging an exchange of knowledge, it aims to build a citizen's voice on education and training issues but also to propose concrete solutions to make lifelong learning a reality for all.&#xd;<br />The platform fosters a vision of lifelong learning that promotes equity, social cohesion and active citizenship. It believes that the objectives of education and training should not only be described in terms of employability or economic growth but also as a framework for personal development. It is essential to raise awareness on the fact that lifelong learning should include a large range of learning settings and create more complementarity and continuity between formal, non-formal and informal learning.&#xd;<br />Objectives:&#xd;<br />- Pursuing an active dialogue with European institutions;&#xd;<br />- Enabling exchanges of best practice, experiences and expertise;&#xd;<br />- Disseminating information on key issues in the lifelong learning sector;&#xd;<br />- Organising events and developing activities in transversal lifelong learning topics;&#xd;<br />- Promoting a more democratic, civic and social Europe;","acronym":"LLLP","interests":"Borders and Security, Budget, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, General and Institutional Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and innovation, Sport, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"Education and Training 2020, Europe 2020 Strategy, TTIP negotiations, VAT Directive, Anti-discrimination Directive, Erasmus+ Programme, Skills Agenda, MFF, EQF","lastUp":"2018-07-24T10:51:34.654+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
