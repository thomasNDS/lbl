Our organisation works in 51 developing countries across Africa, Asia and the Americas. Plan International directly supports more than 1,500,000 children and their families, and supports an estimated further 9,000,000 people who live in communities that are working with Plan. Our organisation has no particular religious, political or governmental affiliations. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Plan International's vision is of a world in which all children realise their full potential in societies that respect people's rights and dignity. Plan works to achieve lasting improvements for children living in poverty in developing countries, through a process that unites people across cultures and adds meaning and value to their lives. In order to achieve these goals Plan enables deprived children, families as well as communities to meet their basic needs and to increase their ability to participate in and benefit from their societies. Furthermore, Plan is building relations to promote understanding among peoples of different cultures. Plan International EU Office in Brussels works to ensure that the promotion and protection of children's rights is a priority in the EU's external action.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Plan international is committed to transparency about EU interest representation. Plan international believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide EU lobbying transparency. When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU.
