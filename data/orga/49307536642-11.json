Members of the Brussels-based UIRR presently operate a network which spans the entire continent, and provides connections beyond Europe to destinations as far as China.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The strategic aims of UIRR are to &#xd;<br />- achieve a balanced regulatory framework for every mode of transport, which enables fair competition based on technical-merit and management excellence; and&#xd;<br />- to grow the market for intermodal transport.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The mission of UIRR is to grow the pie for combined transport through enabling fair competition based on technical merit and management excellence.&#xd;<br />In the course of its work, UIRR focuses on three issues:&#xd;<br />1. The quality performance of rail freight&#xd;<br />2. Promotion of a fair, mode neutral regulatory environment&#xd;<br />3. Enhancement of intermodal transport&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In details:&#xd;<br />Publications such as books, annual reports and statistical data, quarterly newsletters, position papers and press releases on specific (legislative) topics, regular press and conference appearances, events, as well as an informative website - www.uirr.com - serve the purpose of promotion of road-rail Combined Transport by UIRR.  European transport politicians, and officials of the European Commission are regularly contacted by UIRRâ€™s staff to ensure that this sustainable system of freight transport, based on efficiently inserting electric rail into long-distance transport-chains, receives the attention that it deserves in Brussels and Strasbourg.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Enhancement through standardisation, research and development: Coordination of RDI projects that aim at developing new solutions and best practice, participation in European standardisation initiatives (in collaboration with CEN and ERA, as well as UIC), and the facilitation of professional exchanges through the operation stakeholder Interest Groups.    UIRR has contributed to numerous projects aiming to develop solutions for improved safety, security, as well as to devise IT solutions for the better facilitation and easier use of intermodal transport, including activities at transhipment terminals.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Supporting daily operations of road-rail intermodal transport: members regularly meet in six different Interest Groups and at several professional Platforms at UIRR to discuss ways of enhancing operational practices and technologies used, while spreading best practice.  Moreover, UIRR issues electronic terminal and customer codes to be used with the UIRR data-message, an industry standard which is elemental in the communication between various European CT Operators and their clients.  The CESAR tracking and tracing system, established by UIRR member companies, provides valuable information on a daily basis.  More recently, the EN13044 standard mandated UIRR to become the Administrator of the ILU-Code, a standardised owner-identification solution for intermodal loading units (ILUs) - swap-bodies and semi-trailers - used in Europe.","acronym":"UIRR","interests":"Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Energy, Environment, International co-operation and development, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"- Revision of Directive 92/106 concerning Combined Transport&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Revision of Regulation 913/2010 on rail freight corridors&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Enacting the road regulation amendments proposed under the 'Europe on the Move' initiative&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Rail-related implementing acts: access to service facilities, timetabling, profile gauge &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- TSIs developed by the European Union Agency for Railways and collaboration under its Intermodal Task Force&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Upgrading of intermodal-related standards by CEN/CENELEC&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Fundamental interest in every EU legislative initiative which impacts the functioning of freight transport","lastUp":"2018-08-03T08:34:19.171+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
