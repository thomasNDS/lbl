The coalition has been set up in 2006 and has established a coordination office in Brussels. Originally the legal entity was a foundation based in the Netherlands, but in 2018, ECCJ registered as a non-profit organisation (ASBL) under Belgian law.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are guided by a vision of a sustainable world in which corporations’ drive for profit is balanced with the interests of society at large, and where businesses respect human, social and environmental rights.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ECCJ works as a catalyst, drawing on the expertise and experience of organisations across Europe to build a strong corporate accountability movement and provide a united voice at the European level promoting the need for legal change. We build capacities of our members to engage in the EU policy debate and connect it with discussions at national level.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We carry out research with lawyers, academics and civil society organisations in other regions of the world to make the case for greater corporate accountability.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We identify and promote legal proposals and policy recommendations for the EU and its Member States to address the gaps in governance created by economic globalisation. We raise public awareness on how the EU should ensure better protection for human rights and the environment. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In particular, we have the following policy objectives&#xd;<br />- Increase corporate transparency: mandatory disclosure of companies' risks and impacts on human rights and environment and how companies address them, ideally  based on the UNGPs reporting framework.&#xd;<br />- Embed the corporate duty to respect human rights into law: legal measures to make sure that companies respect human rights throughout their operations and in relation to their business relationships including outside the EU. Ideally in the form of binding rules at EU level for a duty-of-care-based human rights due diligence.&#xd;<br />- Address the obstacles faced by victims of corporate-related human rights abuses when trying to access judicial remedies&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ECCJ’s 18 member organisations constitute the coalition’s General Assembly. General Assembly meetings take place once a year to approve the annual work plan and budget, and make decisions regarding core strategic and political issues.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ECCJ is led by an elected board, called Steering Group, made up of representatives of 8 member organisations. The Steering Group is responsible for ECCJ’s Strategic Plan and oversees its implementation through annual Operational Plans. It approves main ECCJ positions with respect to key policy developments and oversees the coalition’s financial management, ensuring its long term financial stability. The Steering Group guides the work of the Secretariat and supports its Coordinator. Members of the Steering Group may occasionally represent ECCJ in public events.","acronym":"ECCJ","interests":"Banking and financial services, Business and Industry, Consumers, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Single market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"CORPORATE TRANSPARENCY&#xd;<br />-Directive 2014/95/EU on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY / SUPPLY CHAIN RESPONSIBILITY&#xd;<br />-EC Communication COM(2011)681–final \"A renewed EU strategy 2011-14 for Corporate Social Responsibility” &#xd;<br />-European Commission flagship initiative on responsible supply chains in the textile sector &#xd;<br />-2014/0059(COD) – “Union system for supply chain due diligence self-certification of responsible importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold originating in conflict-affected and high-risk areas”&#xd;<br />- European Commission Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth (2018)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS&#xd;<br />-The EU strategic framework on human rights and democracy&#xd;<br />- EU implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on BUsiness and Human Rights&#xd;<br />- EU participation in the Open-Ended Inter-Governmental Working Group established by the UN Human Rights Council to develop a binding instrument on business and human rights&#xd;<br />- EU action to embed Human Rights Due Diligence into law&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ACCESS TO REMEDIES&#xd;<br />-Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II)&#xd;<br />-Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters&#xd;<br />- Collective redress and access to evidence&#xd;<br />- Commission Recommendation of 11 June 2013 on common principles for injunctive and compensatory collective redress mechanisms in the Member States concerning violations of rights granted under Union law (2013/396/EU)&#xd;<br />- A New Deal for Consumers –The revision of Directive 2009/22/EC on injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />PRIVATE SECTOR IN DEVELOPMENT&#xd;<br />-EC Communication COM(2014)263 – “A Stronger Role of the Private Sector in Achieving Inclusive and Sustainable Growth in Developing Countries”","lastUp":"2019-04-08T16:19:30.247+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
