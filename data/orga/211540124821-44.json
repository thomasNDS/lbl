Since its foundation in 2001, it is strongly committed to a comparative and interdisciplinary approach to the study of the social and political transformations associated with growing population mobility and cultural diversity. FIERI adopts a comprehensive view of those changes which goes beyond an exclusive focus on migrants and their descendants, and considers instead the whole society and local communities as transformed by migration and mobility.&#xd;<br />FIERI is actively engaged in European and international networks and, at the same time, deeply rooted in the Italian context also through proactive interactions with policy, media and civil society.&#xd;<br />Economic migration and economic integration of migrants have been, since the beginning, one of the key areas of FIERIâ€™s activity.","acronym":"FIERI","interests":"Borders and Security, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, External Relations, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"As a research institute specialising on migration and migration policies, generating policy-relevant knowledge is a key institutional mission for FIERI.
