The initialising reason was, that we contributed to the Consultation on the EU Strategy for the Danube Region and the announcement that the contributions will be published in the Internet - but for registered organisations and only.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are only occasionally starting or joining activities on the EU level. One of this occasions was the Danube Strategy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />So far we did not take part in meetings with the EU parliament, we did meet with Commissions members due to ongoing complaints, and some of the Danube strategy meetings. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our organisation contributed in commenting the refit process of \"habitats directive\" (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora - with subsequent changes).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Currently we are concerned that the refit process of the \"Water Framework Directive\" (Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy)   could lead to a downgrade, whereas member states (eg. Austria) are  still not compliant and implementation of required measuers is postponed. That might require additional action in the future.&#xd;<br />Though we might not fully fit in the scheme of those kind of organisations the transparency register is mainly adressing, we want to be prepared for further action that might require registration may it be necessary.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />On the national level an important focus of our work is the participation in administrative procedures dealing with Environmental affairs, which leads to the requirement of being interested in the legal framework also on the EU level - such as changes in and implementation of the directives mentioned below (in addition to those mentioned above):&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />\"SEA directive\" (Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />\"EIA Directive\" (Directive 2014/52/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council  of 16 April 2014 amending Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment - formerly included: Directive 2003/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending with regard to public participation and access to justice Council Directives 85/337/EEC and 96/61/EC)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />General interests we are pursuing mainly on the national level but where EU-legislation and jurisdiction is of relevance: &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Establish high levels of \"environmental-protection\", without neglecting social effects.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Successfully fight climate change&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Trigger and support a shift towards improved and more sophisticated energy - (not only electricity!) and transport-policies. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Highlighting the differences between transport and mobility&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Keep or reestablish good hydromorphological status of rivers and aquatic bodies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Protect aquatic ecology and drinking water resources&#xd;<br />Nature conservation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Establish open procedures of approval of plans/programmes and projects (such as Strategic Environmental assessment and environmental impact assessment - including the establishment of an adequate levels of \"public participation culture\".&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Establish transparent procedures of decisionmaking when the label \"common interests\" shall be assigned to certain projects and undertakings - including participation &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Proper implementation of international conventions (such as the UN-ECE \"Aarhus\" and  \"Espoo\" - conventions )","acronym":"VIRUS","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Implementation of revised EIA directive (Directive 2014/52/EU)&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />European Court of Justice - legislation regarding 3rd pillar of Aarhus convention&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />\"refit process\" of the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC)","lastUp":"2019-10-15T15:56:24.947+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
