Rallying to the SDG nr 4, Quality of Education, our UNESCO Chair's main goal will be to ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning. With a firm belief in the fact that Education is the key that will allow many other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved, our Chair will act in support of Education to reduce inequalities and to reach gender equality. Education empowers people everywhere to live more healthy and sustainable lives, being crucial to fostering tolerance between people and to building more peaceful societies. In this context, the mission of the UNESCO Chair will continue to be geared towards better serving not only the needs of our students, graduates and learners but also the needs of the wider regional community for more diversified learning programs (re-skilling courses, modules, and curricula programmes), adult education and continuing professional education programs that have emerged along with the new labour market demands and different job profiles.  &#xd;<br />With a view to the above, for the 2019-2023, the specific responsibilities of our UNESCO Chair will be the following: &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1.\tAdopting the mantle of the civic university – pursuing the ‘public good’ by aligning its interests with those of society, and working collaboratively with other HEIs to maximize their collective impact; &#xd;<br />2.\tMaintaining a proactive role in ensuring that the SDGs are included in local agendas, proposing changes to education, and engaging with local and global communities on sustainable development; &#xd;<br />3.\tEducating the SDG Generation needed to make the SDGs a reality, thereby helping to produce new SDG leaders; &#xd;<br />4.\tBuilding capacities for SDG policies, planning and management; &#xd;<br />5.\tEncouraging trans-disciplinarity and refinements of curricula to ensure the mainstreaming of SDG issues across curricula, and including new values and practices for economic development that enhance social equity.","acronym":"UNESCOLBUS","interests":"Communication, Culture, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, External Relations, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Migration and asylum, Research and innovation, Youth","euInitiatives":"FP7, H2020, Erasmus+&#xd;<br />Making lifelong learning and mobility a reality&#xd;<br />Improving the quality and efficiency of education and training&#xd;<br />EAC MSCA Advisory Group&#xd;<br />SDG,the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&#xd;<br />New Skills Agenda for Europe, &#xd;<br />Modernization Agenda for HE","lastUp":"2019-04-20T07:56:42.492+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
