The scope of Seas At Risk includes, but is not limited to, the North Sea, the Irish Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the North-East Atlantic Ocean as well as all countries that border on these waters or have a significant impact on their marine environment. SAR works to realise its goals in a number of ways but key amongst these is its role as a technical and political platform for its members, providing them with a means of collective intervention in international political and legal meetings of government where they would not otherwise have access. While Seas At Risk pursues issues at the international level, individual Seas At Risk member organisations help by ensuring that national government delegations to international meetings are properly briefed and aware of the concerns of their national environment movement. By coordinating lobbying at the national level and ensuring that issues get raised at international meetings of government, Seas At Risk maximises the opportunity for governments to make the right decisions on key issues affecting the protection of the seas and oceans. Seas At Risk is also in an excellent position to make sure that civil society, via its national member organisations, is kept informed of developments in these forums.","acronym":"SAR","interests":"Climate Action, Environment, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Transport","euInitiatives":"Marine litter: As part of our work on marine litter prevention, we work on the circular economy, all aspects of the European strategy for plastics in a circular economy, and the Port Reception Facilities Directive.
