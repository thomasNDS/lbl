We take a balanced approach to capture the wealth management opportunities in emerging markets, the largest of which is in the Asia Pacific region, while also serving key developed markets with an emphasis on Switzerland. Founded in 1856, we today have a global reach with operations in over 50 countries and 47,000 employees from over 170 different nations. Our broad footprint helps us to generate a geographically balanced stream of revenues and net new assets and allows us to capture growth opportunities around the world. We serve our clients through three regionally focused divisions: Swiss Universal Bank, International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific. These regional businesses are supported by two other divisions specializing in investment banking capabilities: Global Markets and Investment Banking &amp; Capital Markets. The Strategic Resolution Unit consolidates the remaining portfolios from the former non-strategic units plus additional businesses and positions that do not fit with our strategic direction. Our business divisions cooperate closely to provide holistic financial solutions, including innovative products and specially tailored advice.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Further information about Credit Suisse can be found at www.credit-suisse.com.","acronym":"CSAG","interests":"Banking and financial services, Climate Action, Competition, Economy, finance and the euro, Energy, Environment, Single market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"Credit Suisse has contributed actively to the EU debate on solving Too Big to Fail Risk for global and European banks, via the EU Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive, CRD5/CRR2; and is engaged in a number of capital markets related policy and legislative initiatives, notably MiFID2/MiFIR, EMIR, Shadow Banking, Capital Markets Union and Securitisation.
