In its Report, that continues to serve as operational blueprint for the Foundation, the High-Level Group stress education, skills and media to renew cultural dialogue, and foresee the centrality of civil society and investment in youth.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our programming is articulated around four&#xd;<br />priority strategic pillars:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Advocacy and Research: Develop a proactive policy to embed Intercultural Dialogue&#xd;<br />policies at the local and national levels based&#xd;<br />on gathering of empirical data and platform&#xd;<br />for media dialogue.&#xd;<br />. Youth Voice and Exchange: Create&#xd;<br />opportunities for youth-led dialogue that&#xd;<br />generates alternative narratives, and provides&#xd;<br />next generations with the skills to build&#xd;<br />together more open, resilient communities.&#xd;<br />. Intercultural Learning and Cities: Enhance,&#xd;<br />embed and multiply intercultural dialogue&#xd;<br />capabilities of the different actors at local,&#xd;<br />national and cross-national level, with&#xd;<br />strategic focus on broadening intercultural&#xd;<br />. Networking and Cooperation: Facilitate&#xd;<br />the creation of Euro-Med collaborations&#xd;<br />and partnerships, map priority areas of&#xd;<br />intervention and synergies among dialogue&#xd;<br />actors, and support collective visible actions&#xd;<br />......","acronym":"ALF","interests":"Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Communication, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, European Neighbourhood Policy, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, International co-operation and development, Research and innovation, Youth","euInitiatives":"education&#xd;<br />(https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=legissum:4324360)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />intercultural dialogue (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2016-0005_EN.html)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />youth issues (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/education_training_youth/1504.html?root=1504)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />conflict prevention (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2019-0158_EN.html)","lastUp":"2019-08-29T15:25:27.067+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
