In a fast-changing transport environment, where individuals’ mobility requirements have become more complex and the role of new forms of transport solutions is increasing, public transport continues to be a key requirement for people with specific needs. In some deprived urban neighbourhoods or remote rural areas across Europe, an efficient and inclusive public transport means greater access to jobs, educational and social opportunities.","lastUp":"2019-03-29T08:06:31.625+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
