It has a strong vision for the role of its members, seeking to promote high professional standards and strong ethics in archaeological practice, to maximise the benefits that archaeologists bring to society and to bring recognition and respect to the archaeological profession. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Institute requires adherence to certain standards, the formulation, maintenance and promotion of which within the archaeological sector is central to its work. The Institute’s standards and guidance regulate ‘person, process and product’.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Through its standards for ‘person’ (individuals and organisations) the Institute recognises expertise in a number of ways, including personal membership which, at a professional grade, involves validation of technical and ethical competence, and corporate membership in the form of 'Registered Organisations'.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Institute sets standards for ‘process and product’ through its Standards and guidance which are now widely accepted and endorsed in commercial work undertaken for developers through the planning process and elsewhere within the sector and are a key tool to ensure that the historic environment is properly managed and protected.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Institute promotes, facilitates and provides vocational training and assessment and the continuing professional development of its members.","acronym":"CIfA","interests":"Agriculture, Competition, Culture, Environment","euInitiatives":"Response to consultations.","lastUp":"2018-06-05T11:51:42.786+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
