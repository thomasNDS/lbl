BPIE is also involved as a partner in several EU projects.&#xd;<br />BPIE's goal is to make a sustainable and low carbon built environment a reality in Europe. BPIE supports a multifaceted approach to achieve efficiency improvements and to integrate renewable energy in buildings. The focus of work is on ensuring the effective implementation of the 2010 EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) and the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive (EED); as well as the financing and delivery of energy efficiency retrofits to existing buildings. Best practice approaches are also promoted to improve the energy performance of buildings in different Member States.","acronym":"BPIE","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"BPIE focuses on ensuring the implementation of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) and the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), as well as the financing and delivery of energy efficiency retrofits to existing buildings. In order to do so, BPIE works together with policy makers to support evidence-based impactful policy making by providing data and knowledge through its Data Hub and through several reports. BPIE analyzed for instance the renovation strategies Member States had to submit according to article 4 of the EED, and wrote a report gathering recommendations for Member States and policy-makers at the EU level.&#xd;<br />BPIE has also been part of winning consortia for the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7) and the Intelligent Energy Europe programme (IEE) of the EU. BPIE is involved, in 2018, in the following EU projects:&#xd;<br />•HRE (Heat Roadmap Europe)-(2016-2019)&#xd;<br />The project will enable new policies as well as prepare the ground for new investments by creating more certainty in relation to the changes that are required. The project is covering 14 member states accounting for 85 to 90 % of the heating and cooling energy demand in the EU.  &#xd;<br />•EmBuild-Empower public authorities to establish a long-term strategy for mobilizing investment in the energy efficient renovation of the building stock (2016-2018). With exploring and demonstrating the pioneer role of the public sector, this project aims to lead the way to an energy efficient building stock.&#xd;<br />•ExcEED - European Energy Efficient building district Database: from data to information to knowledge (2016-2019). ExcEED has the overall objective to create a European self-sustainable and dynamic database for measured and qualitative data on beyond the state of the art buildings and districts.&#xd;<br />•EUCalc - EU Calculator: trade-offs and pathways towards sustainable and low-carbon EU Societies (2016-2019).The EUCalc project will deliver an urgently needed comprehensive framework for research, business, and public sector decision makers which identifies and enables an appraisal of synergies and trade-offs of feasible European decarbonisation pathways.&#xd;<br />•iBRoad – Individual Building Renovation Roadmap (2017-2020).iBROAD aims to empower consumers and support them in taking informed decision concerning building renovation, based on their Individual Building Renovation Roadmaps. At the same time, this approach is expected to empower home-owners with knowledge and experience of deep renovation, to provide energy auditors with a practical tool and to provide public authorities with real-life examples of residential deep renovation.&#xd;<br />Before 2018, BPIE supported the realization of other projects, such as:&#xd;<br />•ZEBRA 2020-Putting a spotlight on the soar of low-energy buildings in Europe (2014-2016)&#xd;<br />The project will monitor the market uptake of low-energy buildings across Europe and thereby generate data and evidence for policy evaluation and optimisation. &#xd;<br />•EASEE-Envelope approach to improve sustainability and energy efficiency in existing multi-storey multi-owner residential buildings (2012-2017). This FP7 project aims at developing a new holistic approach to energy efficient envelope retrofitting of multi-storey and multi-owner buildings built before 1975. &#xd;<br />•CommONEnergy-Converting EU shopping malls into energy efficiency lighthouses (2013-2017). During the next four years, researchers and industry partners will be teaming-up to look for solutions and strategies to transform shopping malls into energy efficient architectures and systems. The solutions will be submitted to a real-life test, on three specific demonstration cases in Italy, Norway and Spain.","lastUp":"2018-03-06T10:54:29.450+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"700000-799999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
