The focus is on ensuring the vigorous implementation of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) and the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) across EU Member States, as well as to enhance financing of deep energy renovation of the existing buildings. &#xd;<br />BPIE provides open-source research, analysis, knowledge-sharing and advisory activities to the European Institutions, policy-makers in EU Member States and neighbouring countries, the scientific community as well as private sector stakeholders and the civil society. In Germany, Poland and Romania, BPIE has established country programmes to support the implementation of the EU buildings policies and related efforts to capacity building. In addition, BPIE has a large network of organisations in all European countries with which it collaborates regularly.&#xd;<br />BPIE is focused on providing policy analysis, advice and support to better implement deep renovation measures of the existing EU building stock and to foster the transition towards nearly zero-energy buildings. Among others, BPIE was or is currently involved in EU-funded projects such as ENTRANZE, CommONEnergy, EASEE, Episcope, Cohereno, Zebra, EmBuild, HRE, ExcEED, EuCalc, RenOnBill, Turnkey Retrofit, Ambience and iBRoad. &#xd;<br />The multi-national team at BPIE has a broad range of expertise relevant to the field of energy and buildings with university degrees in a variety of disciplines and is multi-lingual covering at least 8 languages.","acronym":"BPIE","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"BPIE focuses on ensuring the implementation of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) and the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), as well as the financing and delivery of energy efficiency retrofits to existing buildings. In order to do so, BPIE works together with policy makers to support evidence-based impactful policy making by providing data and knowledge through its Data Hub and through several reports. BPIE analyzed for instance the renovation strategies Member States had to submit according to article 4 of the EED, and wrote a report gathering recommendations for Member States and policy-makers at the EU level.&#xd;<br />BPIE has also been part of winning consortia for the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7) and the Intelligent Energy Europe programme (IEE) of the EU. BPIE is involved, in 2018, in the following EU projects:&#xd;<br />•HRE (Heat Roadmap Europe)-(2016-2019)&#xd;<br />The project will enable new policies as well as prepare the ground for new investments by creating more certainty in relation to the changes that are required. The project is covering 14 member states accounting for 85 to 90 % of the heating and cooling energy demand in the EU.  &#xd;<br />•EmBuild-Empower public authorities to establish a long-term strategy for mobilizing investment in the energy efficient renovation of the building stock (2016-2018). With exploring and demonstrating the pioneer role of the public sector, this project aims to lead the way to an energy efficient building stock.&#xd;<br />•ExcEED - European Energy Efficient building district Database: from data to information to knowledge (2016-2019). ExcEED has the overall objective to create a European self-sustainable and dynamic database for measured and qualitative data on beyond the state of the art buildings and districts.&#xd;<br />•EUCalc - EU Calculator: trade-offs and pathways towards sustainable and low-carbon EU Societies (2016-2019).The EUCalc project will deliver an urgently needed comprehensive framework for research, business, and public sector decision makers which identifies and enables an appraisal of synergies and trade-offs of feasible European decarbonisation pathways.&#xd;<br />•iBRoad – Individual Building Renovation Roadmap (2017-2020).iBROAD aims to empower consumers and support them in taking informed decision concerning building renovation, based on their Individual Building Renovation Roadmaps. At the same time, this approach is expected to empower home-owners with knowledge and experience of deep renovation, to provide energy auditors with a practical tool and to provide public authorities with real-life examples of residential deep renovation.&#xd;<br />X-tendo (2019-2022): eXTENDing the energy performance assessment and certification schemes via a mOdular approach  (2019-2022)&#xd;<br />ENEFIRST (2019-2022)\"Efficiency First\" (E1st) is a fundamental principle applied to policymaking, planning and investment in the energy sector, which is gaining visibility in European energy and climate policy. ENEFIRST will help making the E1st principle more concrete and operational, better understand its relevance for energy demand and supply and its broader impacts across sectors and markets, focussing on the buildings sector. Its main objectives are to define the principle of E1st in practical terms, assess how it has been applied internationally and how it applies to the EU context, to assess the value of applying E1st across different policy areas for buildings’ end-use energy efficiency and to quantify the impacts of increased building energy efficiency for the future energy system in the EU as well as to identify key policy areas for the application of E1st and develop policy proposals for its implementation in the EU","lastUp":"2019-09-20T12:54:07.954+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"700000-799999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
