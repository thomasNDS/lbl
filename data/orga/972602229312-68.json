The primary target for this work is manufacturers, distributors and retailers who have the market position and potential to expand usage of American peanuts and peanut products.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-Monitoring and addressing technical issues that threaten trade with the EU. Aflatoxin contamination and pesticide residue levels (MRLs) are the main trade issues that the U.S. peanut industry encounters in Europe. APC actively monitors new developments and regulations on both issues and intervenes when necessary. The organization works with both U.S. and E.U. government officials to make sure that all decisions regarding MRLs and aflatoxin are based on sound scientific data. At the same time, APC will continue to work with international organizations such as Codex to set standardized aflatoxin and MRL tolerances that are achievable by exporters, while still guaranteeing consumer safety.","lastUp":"2019-10-24T10:46:50.699+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"500000-599999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
