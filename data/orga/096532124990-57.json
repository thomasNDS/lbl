Services offered range from prototyping and small-scale production to materials testing, emissions testing, vehicle testing, type approval of vehicles and their components and technical consultancy, among others. Various departments carry out R&amp;D activities (mainly – but not exclusively – for paying customers), often employing the test methods in the latest version of EU legislation in the relevant area. Exhaust emissions are a significant part of the work which BOSMAL performs and BOSMAL staff closely follow developments in the EU automotive legislative landscape as concerns emissions from light- and heavy-duty vehicles and their engines. As a company with multiple customers who have to meet exhaust emissions limits and fleet average CO2 emissions limits, monitoring legislation in that area is of importance to BOSMAL in being able to assist customers in meeting their goals and plan for the near future. &#xd;<br />Specifically, BOSMAL pays special attention to all legislation on exhaust emissions from light- and heavy-duty vehicles: Directive 2007/46/EC, Regulation 715/2007/EC, Regulation 692/2008/EC, Regulation (EU) 2016/427, Regulation 595/2009/EC, Commission Regulation (EU) 582/2011 and the recently released Regulations on the WLTP and RDE testing: Commission Regulations 2017/1151, 2017/1152, 2017/1153, 2017/1154. Given their importance to the aforementioned topics, Directive 2009/28/EC and Directive 2009/30/EC are also of interest and any [proposed] changes to these pieces of legislation would be closely followed. Directive (EU) 2016/802 is also of interest.&#xd;<br />Projects carried out using research grants and BOSMAL’s own scientific funds also rely (to various extents) on EU legislation as a source of test methods and a source of general information on the wider policy aims of legislation and the test types and limits imposed.","lastUp":"2018-02-20T10:05:11.070+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
