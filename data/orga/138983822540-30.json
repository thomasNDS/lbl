CER has been carrying out researches on the rational use of water resources since 1959. CER has become involved in various projects financed by the EU since 1990. The main fields of research that have been developed over the years are the following: crop response to irrigation; Irrigation scheduling aimed at the quality; development of irrigation management techniques with minimised environmental impact; establishment of the parameters of plant growth, yield and product quality development; Decision Support Systems for managing the water supply and the irrigation systems; studies about the circulation of nutrient and plant protection additives in the ground and in the water; fertigation and chemigation; irrigation technologies and design of irrigation systems; water treatments in constructed wetland at the farm scale; extension services support. These activities have brought about the identification and validation of the crucial parameters required to calculate the water requirements of the main local crops and the development of applicative models (Videotel, Emilia Romagna Integrated Crop Management DSS, BEau-Geste, Irrigere , Tecnirri, Pluvio, Irrinet an Fertirrigere) which are used  at regional and national level.&#xd;<br />CER is the point of reference for the Emilia Romagna Government, Institutional water stakeholders and Grower Associations  for what concern the rational use of water in agriculture, water quality for irrigation both for the agriculture and urban landscape, and for the evaluation of  possibility to reuse treated waste water (TWW) for irrigation purposes.","acronym":"CER","interests":"Agriculture, Climate Action, Environment, Food Safety, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"EIP Water Task Force&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EIP Water Action Group WIRE (Coordination)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />DG-ENV.
