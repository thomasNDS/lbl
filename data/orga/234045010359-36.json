Reflecting the complexities of “health” as defined by WHO, the EIWH represents a mix of individuals and  organisations bringing together the interests of patients, consumers, women’s health and gender mainstreaming and social advocates, academics, health professionals and researchers, working together to promote better health for all.","acronym":"EIWH","interests":"Communication, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Food Safety, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Sport, Youth","euInitiatives":"The EIWH is a member of the Patient and Consumer Working Party of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This group provides recommendations to EMA human scientific committees on all matters of interest to patients in relation to medicinal products.  The European Medicines Agency is the European Union (EU) body responsible for the scientific evaluation and approval of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies. The EMA centrally reviews and approves innovative medicinal products, based on the clinical trial data supplied by the applicant organisation. This approval process is strictly defined and regulated by EU legislation. Once approved, the medicinal product receives a marketing authorisation for use in the EU and European Economic Area (EEA).  The EMA Human Scientific Committees’ Working Party with Patients’ and Consumers’ Organisations (PCWP) was established in 2005 to provide recommendations to the EMA and its Human Scientific Committees on all matters of direct or indirect interest to patients in relation to medicinal products.  &#xd;<br />Women are some of the heaviest users of medicines, starting early with birth control pills and across their lifespan as longevity champions. Additionally, due to women’s reproductive and their caring role in society, women have a specific interest in, but also knowledge to offer about medicines use for themselves and their families.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The promotion of health and wellbeing across the lifecourse and prevention of chronic disease is a priority for the EIWH and supports the EU Commission policies on health promotion and disease prevention &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The growing resistance to many antibiotics is a public health threat that has been steadily increasing over recent decades.  Many common infections are becoming difficult or even impossible to treat, sometimes turning a simple infection into a life- threatening condition. As a result, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) annually holds European Antibiotics Awareness Day on 18 November to raise awareness and show that combating resistance to last-line antibiotics remains a priority in the European (EU).The EIWH supports the annual Antimicrobial Awareness Day on the 18th of November.&#xd;<br />The EIWH developed a key vaccination policy brief titled ‘Women and Vaccination in the EU’. In support of European Immunisation Week in April 2017, the EIWH re-issued this vaccination policy brief with a press release to media. A social media campaign saw pertinent vaccination information and messages being shared daily. The aim of the campaign was to increase awareness of the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of infectious disease which is particularly relevant at a time when vaccination participation is decreasing. The EIWH actively engaged in promoting the public health value of vaccinations and encouraging the development of EU-wide vaccination strategy.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EIWH supports the establishment of the EU Joint Action on Vaccination and is part of the Stakeholder platform of the JA and will support and contribute to the new Joint Action.&#xd;<br />The EIWH continues to promote the inclusion of sex and gender in biomedical and health research in H2020 and now looks to the 9th Framework programme for rsearch and Innovation.&#xd;<br />Health Technology Assessment &#xd;<br />HTA is an important part of evidence-based decision-making on health.  The EIWH supports the the European Commission initiative on strengthening EU cooperation on HTA.  The EIWH is a member of the HTA Network Stakeholder Pool.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Digital Europe&#xd;<br />The EIWH has an interest in technology , ICT and e and m health and how it can improve access to  prevention of disease and healthcare for men and women","lastUp":"2019-09-09T13:55:14.861+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
