The organisation focuses its activities on an integrated approach, taking various aspects into account:&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />    Nutrition, health and healthcare practices&#xd;<br />    Food security and livelihoods&#xd;<br />    Water, sanitation and hygiene&#xd;<br />    Advocacy and awareness-raising&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />In 2015, ACF-International was active in over 58 countries, coming to the aid of around 15 million individuals.  By integrating our programmes with regional and national systems, ACF is ensuring that short-term actions are becoming long-term solutions.","acronym":"ACF","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Borders and Security, Climate Action, External Relations, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development","euInitiatives":"Nutrition, health and healthcare practices&#xd;<br />    Food security and livelihoods&#xd;<br />    Water, sanitation and hygiene&#xd;<br />    Advocacy and awareness-raising","lastUp":"2019-10-16T10:44:49.075+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
