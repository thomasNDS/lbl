Our approach will be to engage constructively with policy makers but to challenge forcefully the current status quo that continues to see our technologies and ideas left on the shelf rather than deployed to the benefit of Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The European Alliance to Save Energy will make this happen by:&#xd;<br />• Giving energy efficiency a stronger voice: Senior business leaders from the energy efficiency industry have not done enough to ensure that their voice is heard; the Alliance creates a platform from which they can put this right and join with politicians and thought leaders to ensure our voice is heard&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />• Giving energy efficiency a broader voice: The Alliance offers a platform for all energy efficiency industry and supporters alike&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />• Giving policy makers a port of call on big issues: A number of high level policies can be supported by energy efficiency; the Alliance will offer policy makers a partner for looking at what energy efficiency as a whole can play to support these policies and what new policies are needed&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />• Creating awareness of the breadth of products and services that exist: There are many technologies, products and services that remain on the shelf because of a lack of the right policy mix; the Alliance will create awareness of these opportunities and the policies needed &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />• Breaking the empty consensus on energy efficiency : Energy efficiency is supported in principle by all but often left on the sidelines when major policy is decided: the Alliance will provide a platform to break this empty consensus","acronym":"EU-ASE","interests":"Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Consumers, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Implementation of the 2020 energy and climate, definition of an energy efficiency target for 2030, definition of the Energy Union.","lastUp":"2019-02-18T14:23:15.679+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"400000-499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
