Our impressive track record in resolving major challenges related to public policy, regulatory affairs and societal issues is founded upon our in-depth knowledge, understanding and appreciation of European policy drivers and their interface with national political systems. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our unique approach, which respects European political tradition rather than try to impose an imported lobbying model, is so successful because we focus on creating a constructive dialogue with policy-makers; a dialogue that is cognisant of Europe’s rich cultural diversity.    &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Be it for public policy, regulatory affairs or compliance we are specialists in institutional processes at both European and national levels. Compromise building is at the heart of what we do and we have built a reputation of working out sustainable solutions that are widely accepted and which build value over the long-term.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our expertise is in government and we work with all industry sectors although we are particularly recognised for our work in the fields of agriculture, chemicals, competition policy, energy, food, financial services, ICT and transport. Our clients are mostly multi-national companies but we also serve European or national industry federations and assist public authorities from outside the EU. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Discretion and confidentiality are key to our work. We attach great importance to respect for ethical values and sustainable business excellence. As such EPPA offers an unparalleled depth of experience and record of success to its clients, many of whom have remained with us for years.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPPA SA is an independent organisation based in Brussels, Belgium and not affiliated in any manner to any other entity with a similar name in Belgium or in any other country.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"-REACH&#xd;<br />-Biocidal products regulation&#xd;<br />-Plant protection products regulation&#xd;<br />-Tobacco products directive&#xd;<br />-Economic partnership agreements&#xd;<br />-Agricultural common market organisation regulation&#xd;<br />-RoHS&#xd;<br />-Energy policy&#xd;<br />-EU Trade policy&#xd;<br />-Transatlantic Trade &amp; Investment Partnership","lastUp":"2019-09-24T16:55:23.713+02:00","customers":"Bayer","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"800000-899999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":""}
