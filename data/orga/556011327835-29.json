There are 12 member organisations representing the European food supply chain. Participation in the European Food SCP Round Table is also open to consumer representative organisations and environmental/nature conservation NGOs.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The European Food SCP Round Table’s unique structure, with participation of all food supply chain members at European level on an equal footing, enables it to take a harmonised, life cycle approach and facilitates an open and results-driven dialogue among all players along the food chain.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The European Food SCP Round Table’s vision is to promote a science-based, coherent approach to sustainable consumption and production in the food sector across Europe, while taking into account environmental interactions at all stages of the food chain. A key principle is that environmental information communicated along the food chain, including to consumers, shall be scientifically reliable and consistent, understandable and not misleading, so as to support informed choice.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The aim of the European Food SCP Round Table is to establish the food chain as a major contributor towards sustainable consumption and production in Europe. The European Food SCP Round Table's activities will not only help to strengthen the long-term competitiveness of Europe's food chain, but also support EU policy objectives, notably those outlined in the European Commission’s Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) and Sustainable Industrial Policy. The European Food SCP Round Table is also taking into account the global SCP agenda, including the initiatives facilitated by UNEP and other organisations to advance resource efficiency, sustainable value chains and social responsibility.","acronym":"Food SCP Round Table","interests":"Agriculture, Consumers, Environment, Food Safety","euInitiatives":"The activities of the European Food SCP Round Table support EU policy objectives, notably those outlined in the European Commission’s Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) and Sustainable Industrial Policy.","lastUp":"2018-07-17T09:48:00.305+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
