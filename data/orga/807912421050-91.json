Stimulating more economic activity and jobs by creating the right regulatory environment, removing unreasonable taxes.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />4. Making Air Passenger Rights simple and clear by providing clarity to the EC Regulation 261/2004; advocating politicians to limit the recourse to both national and EU Courts for interpretation of the Regulation.","acronym":"A4E","interests":"Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Customs, Economy, finance and the euro, Energy, Environment, Institutional affairs, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"- Single European Sky&#xd;<br />- EU Aviation Strategy&#xd;<br />- Airport Charges Directive&#xd;<br />- Air Passenger Rights&#xd;<br />- EU ETS for aviation and environmental policies&#xd;<br />- EASA Basic Regulation&#xd;<br />- Security policies","lastUp":"2019-07-31T12:28:10.318+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1250000-1499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
