With our modular approach, EVs can satisfy both essential constraints: be affordable and versatile, with occasional long distance trip ability and peace of mind. Pure EV with a reasonable battery on daily usage, and plug-in hybrid for longer trips, by towing an energy module on demand.  The Tenders are powered indifferently by gasoline, hydrogen, battery or inductive road as provided by the infrastructure and technology progress.","acronym":"","interests":"Energy, Environment, Transport","euInitiatives":"We are following in particular H2020 SME initiative, and more generally all policies with a link to supporting innovation and SME development.","lastUp":"2019-07-25T14:33:37.116+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
