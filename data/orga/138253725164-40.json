Established to support the UK process manufacturing industry, CPI collaborates with universities, SMEs and large corporates to help overcome innovation challenges and develop next generation products and processes. Operating across a broad range of technologies, we support our partners at every step of the way; from concept to market; business support to technology development; from scale up to supply chain intervention.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CPI supports a sector which currently exports almost £50bn a year with a contribution of over £15bn a year to the UK’s Gross Domestic Product1. CPI leverages its assets, providing significant return on investment which nurtures and supports innovation in this sector. This is imperative if we are to compete in a global market place. However, operating within this innovation space is not without risk, both micro and macro.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />At CPI we understand the risks involved and have developed the CPI Innovation Integrator® model to support businesses and projects; identifying challenges and opportunities whilst supporting on risk mitigation to prove that new products and processes are viable before moving onto full scale production.","acronym":"CPI","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Energy, Environment, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research &amp; Innovation&#xd;<br />•\tNanotechnologies, Advanced Materials, Biotechnology, and Advanced Manufacturing and Processing, NMBP.&#xd;<br />•\tInformation and Communication Technologies, ICT&#xd;<br />•\t◦Societal Challenge 1, (Health, demographic change and wellbeing)&#xd;<br />•\tSocietal Challenge 5, (Climate Action, Environment, Resource Efficiency and Raw Materials)&#xd;<br />•\tSocietal Challenge 2, (Food Security, Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry, Marine, Maritime and Inland Water Research and the Bio-economy)","lastUp":"2019-12-06T10:41:22.738+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
