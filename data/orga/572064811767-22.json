The EU &#xd;<br /> wood panel industry has a turnover of about &#xd;<br /> 22 billion euro every year, creates over 100,000 &#xd;<br /> jobs directly and counts more than 5,000 &#xd;<br /> enterprises in Europe. &#xd;<br />Furthermore, every job in the wood-panel &#xd;<br /> industry generates a multiple of jobs in the &#xd;<br /> downstream user sectors such as the further &#xd;<br /> processing companies and the users in the &#xd;<br /> building, furniture and packaging industries, &#xd;<br /> which have a strong SME character. &#xd;<br />  Additionally, wood panel factories are often &#xd;<br /> located in rural, less industrialized or developed &#xd;<br /> areas, making an important contribution to the &#xd;<br /> local economy.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Since 1 January 1999, the European Panel &#xd;<br /> Federation (EPF), represents the European &#xd;<br /> manufacturers of particleboard, MDF and &#xd;<br /> OSB, with a total production in 2011 of more &#xd;<br /> than 30 million m3 of particleboard, more &#xd;<br /> than 11.5 million m3 of MDF and more than &#xd;<br /> 3.5 million m3 of OSB. EPF thus took over &#xd;<br /> the tasks of FESYP, the  European federation &#xd;<br /> of associations of the particleboard manufacturers &#xd;<br /> (founded in 1958) and Euro MDF Board, the &#xd;<br /> European federation of MDF manufacturers &#xd;<br /> (founded in 1986). In March 2012 also the &#xd;<br /> leading European manufacturers of wet &#xd;<br /> process fibreboards decided to join EPF, &#xd;<br /> who were previously represented by FEROPA. &#xd;<br /> Since then, EPF also operates the ‘Natural &#xd;<br /> Fibre Boards’ (NFB) trademark. In March 2015, &#xd;<br /> EPF also welcomed the application of the majorityof the European plywood manufacturers to become regular members and constituted a dedicated plywood product group and plywood taks force.","acronym":"EPF","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Customs, Economy, finance and the euro, Energy, Environment, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market","euInitiatives":"Renewable Energy, Raw material, ETS, Sustainability, Waste, Recycling, LULUCF, ILUC, Circular economy","lastUp":"2019-07-09T09:32:28.796+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
