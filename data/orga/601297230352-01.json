Whether they are for-profit or not-for-profit, they have a key role to play in the creation of social and corporate value that can – and should – go hand in hand. The leaders in this transition are those who understand the importance of “being connected”: with their own aspirations, with the people around them, and with the organizations and communities to which they contribute. As a consultant and coach, I delight in supporting people to become these sought-after leaders.&#xd;<br />I have been a communication and management consultant for more than 17 years, working with businesses, industrial associations, universities, and government agencies. I combine management-oriented degrees (MSc in Bioengineering and Industrial Marketing) with more people-oriented training (Body-focused Therapist).","acronym":"DEBU","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Transport","euInitiatives":"Energy Union, Emissions Trading Scheme, Circular Economy, Ecodesign, Food Waste","lastUp":"2018-02-23T14:04:32.634+01:00","customers":"Copper Alliance,People N.V.","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":"0-99999"}
