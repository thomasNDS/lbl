We promote transparent, environmentally sensitive grid development to enable further steady growth of renewable energy and the energy transition.”&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Mission Statement is translated into three long term achievment to which RGI will contribute:&#xd;<br />1) Full Clarity on the Need for Grids in the Electricity System to Integrate an Increasing share of RES&#xd;<br />2)Sharing and Implementation of Best Practice and Innovative Approaches&#xd;<br />3)Supportive Political, Policy and Regulatory Frame &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />These long term achievemnets are operationalized via Strategic Objectives and supporting activities, respectively:&#xd;<br />SO1. RGI has developed a comprehensive narrative which resonates with and is supported by its own partners and other external stakeholders and is communicated to all relevant European and national Institution&#xd;<br />SO2. RGI supports initiatives to improve transparency, participation and nature protection during all grid implementation stages, thus leading to better projects and contributing to public support for the grid necessary for an increasingly renewables-based power system.&#xd;<br />SO3.  RGI builds public support and advocates for sustainable grid development with relevant EU and national legislative, regulatory and implementing institutions, and for supporting policies and good governance.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />These goals are being worked upon via the different RGI work packages/activities, which build upon the commonly known RGI Roles: &#xd;<br />Organisational enablers&#xd;<br />• RGI provides the leading platform for cooperation between TSOs and NGOs; the secretariat facilitates the continued dialogue of all partners and fosters an atmosphere of trust and mutual understanding of the different but jointly reinforcing roles of RGI partners in society.&#xd;<br />• RGI helps to establish new TSO/NGO relationships to enable achievement of the strategic objectives.&#xd;<br />• RGI supports NGO fundraising activities and considers NGO needs in its own fundraising activities, to secure adequate and targeted NGO participation and contributions to achieving the strategic objectives.&#xd;<br />• The secretariat ensures that the added value for members of RGI is always clear by:&#xd;<br />  o transparently communicating the nature, purpose and      outcomes of the secretariat’s work.&#xd;<br />  o regularly reviewing RGI activities with its members.&#xd;<br />• RGI will focus on new members and partnerships including TSOs and NGOs and&#xd;<br />other grid-related actors in the energy community such as DSOs; this will allow RGI to broaden its stakeholder representation and intervention opportunities.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Renewables Grid Initiative e.V., is managing and legally representing the Renewables-Grid-Initiative (RGI) which was originally founded in 2009.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We register in this database under section II BUT we do not consider ourselves a lobby organisation.","acronym":"RGI","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment","euInitiatives":"Ongoing:&#xd;<br />- Provide input to the Energy Union.&#xd;<br />- Further development of joint industy and NGO key messages to inform policy makers.&#xd;<br />- Promote regulatory recognition of good practice (incl.compensation).&#xd;<br />- Supporting the implementation of best practices:&#xd;<br />  - Task force on underground cables&#xd;<br />  - Overview of avian data collected by TSOs&#xd;<br />  - Green corridors Project&#xd;<br />  - Marine European grid declaration &#xd;<br />- Facilitating the development of a TYNDP Paris Agreement complaint scenario, in collaboration with ENTSO-E and the NGOs community.&#xd;<br />- NGO capacity building on policy and regulation&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- TEN-E Regulation, its evaluation and implementation, incl.
