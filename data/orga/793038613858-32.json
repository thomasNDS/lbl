We promote transparent, environmentally sensitive grid development to enable further steady growth of renewable energy and the energy transition.”&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Mission Statement is translated into three long term achievment to which RGI will contribute:&#xd;<br />1) Full Clarity on the Need for Grids in the Electricity System to Integrate an Increasing share of RES&#xd;<br />2)Sharing and Implementation of Best Practice and Innovative Approaches&#xd;<br />3)Supportive Political, Policy and Regulatory Frame &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />These long term achievemnets are operationalized via Strategic Objectives and supporting activities, respectively:&#xd;<br />SO1. RGI has developed a comprehensive narrative which resonates with and is supported by its own partners and other external stakeholders and is communicated to all relevant European and national Institution&#xd;<br />SO2. RGI supports initiatives to improve transparency, participation and nature protection during all grid implementation stages, thus leading to better projects and contributing to public support for the grid necessary for an increasingly renewables-based power system.&#xd;<br />SO3.
