A new type of knowledge networks makes it possible to link these and facilitates the selection and analysis of relevant data. The information obtained in this way helps manufacturing companies to decisively optimise planning and decision-making processes such as supply chain management. Alongside supply chain management, another area of emphasis for the project is on market research.","acronym":"SDW","interests":"Digital economy and society, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market; (revision of) EU Database Directive 96/9/EC","lastUp":"2018-08-15T15:43:37.131+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
