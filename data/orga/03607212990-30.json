We have a keen interest in ETS III, ETS IV, fossil CO2 emission reduction targets and legislation regarding the use of renewable energy. &#xd;<br />We believe that European climate change policies should not be tightened in the absence of international agreements. We therefore recommend that the EU gives greater priority to improving the overall competitive situation of industry in Europe towards which lowering energy prices forms an important step. In general we favour policies that promote the circular economy concept and stimulate the recovery of waste paper. Waste paper or recovered paper as it is called in our industry is the basis raw material for our base product which is paper produced on the basis of recovered papers (fibres).","lastUp":"2019-03-18T11:04:57.859+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
