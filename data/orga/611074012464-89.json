Patients with these devastating diseases often have no effective treatment options, and they and their families suffer with little hope. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our first commercial product is Soliris® (eculizumab), the world's first and only approved terminal complement inhibitor. Today, Soliris is approved in nearly 50 countries as a treatment for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and in the United States, European Union, Japan and other countries as a treatment for patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Both PNH and aHUS are life-threatening, ultra-rare diseases. &#xd;<br />In August 2017 the European Commission (EC) approved the extension of the indication for Soliris® (eculizumab) to include the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive, an ultra-rare subset of patients who continues to suffer from severe disease symptoms and complications despite therapies currently used for MG, a debilitating, chronic and progressive autoimmune neuromuscular disease.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Alexion's metabolic franchise includes two highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies for patients with life-threatening and ultra-rare disorders: Strensiq® (asfotase alfa) is approved for patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP) and Kanuma® (sebelipase alfa) is approved for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D).","acronym":"Alexion","interests":"Budget, Business and Industry, Competition, Consumers, External Relations, General and Institutional Affairs, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation","euInitiatives":"Alexion monitors and follows policy of relevance for the biopharmaceutical sector.
