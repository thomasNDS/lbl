With 11,000 kilometres of extra-high-voltage lines, Amprion operates the longest transmission grid in Germany and thus supplies more than 29 million people. As one of four transmission grid operators in Germany, Amprion is responsible for coordinating interconnected operations in Germany and in the northern part of the European extra-high voltage grid. Located in the centre of Europe, Amprion's grid is an important hub for European electricity trading and provides transmission capacity at the interconnectors to its neighbours France, the Netherlands and Switzerland through market-based auctions. To enable us to continue to operate our grid safely and reliably far into the future, we are upgrading and expanding it in line with the needs and demands that lie ahead of us. By doing so, Amprion is taking on its share of responsibility for a sustainable energy supply, as well as for a secure and stable transmission grid in Germany and Europe in accordance with the legal requirements contained in Section 12 of the German Energy Industry Act (EnWG) and Regulation 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2013.","acronym":"Amprion","interests":"Banking and financial services, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Research and innovation, Single market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Energy Union Strategy; Clean Energy Package and its implementation process; Energy infrastructure (TEN-E Programme, PCI -  Review Reg. 347/2013); Development, adoption and implementation of EU network codes und guidelines; Future Decarbonisation/Gas Package (PtG, sector coupling); 2050 Long-term Decarbonisation Strategy (Clean Planet for all); Sustainable Finance; Environmental and RES legislation; Environmental and Energy State Aid Guidelines; REMIT and transparency; Digitalisation of the energy system and cybersecurity","lastUp":"2019-07-22T14:48:07.839+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
