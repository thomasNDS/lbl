Consisting of 48 pan-European networks of NGOs, Social Platform campaigns to ensure that EU policies are developed in partnership with the people they affect, respecting fundamental rights, promoting solidarity and improving lives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Rather than being merely interest representatives, NGOs member of Social Platform represent a structured voice of engaged citizens and civil society. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In that respect, NGOs member of Social Platform build European solidarity and help reduce the gap between politicians and citizens by enabling local organisations and people to participate in European decisions which have an impact on their lives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Social Platform is committed to transparency about EU interest representation.  Social Platform believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide EU lobbying transparency.  When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all the relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow the guidelines that result from consultation with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobbying transparency as well as experts on US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of Social Platform, carry out such activities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU.
