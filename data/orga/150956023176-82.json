Our actions help the most vulnerable in our society as well the environment by reducing organic food waste.&#xd;<br />We started by saving 12 cheese pies from a bakery in 2011 and today we save &amp; offer the equivalent of more than 20.000 portions of food on a daily basis. Since the beginning of our action we have saved &amp; offered more than 28 million portions of food to hundreds of welfare organizations and charities all over Greece.&#xd;<br />We approach the issue of food waste holistically through the following programs:&#xd;<br />•\t“Stop Food Waste”: increasing awareness about food waste&#xd;<br />•\t“Boroume at School”: educational program&#xd;<br />•\t“Boroume Gleaning”: reducing food waste on the field&#xd;<br />•\t“Boroume at the Farmers’ Market”: reducing food waste at farmer’s markets&#xd;<br />•\t“Boroume in the Neighborhood”: informing potential food donors in a neighborhood about our food saving mechanism&#xd;<br />Through our “We Are Family” program we provide nutritional support in an immediate, transparent und dignified way to families in great need.&#xd;<br />Our vision is to develop a social movement to reduce food waste and at the same time increase nutritional support to people in need based on volunteer support.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Consumers, Environment, Food Safety, Humanitarian aid and civil protection","euInitiatives":"Membership on the EU Platform for Food Losses and Food Waste&#xd;<br />Participation at the Horizon 2020 program \"NEMESIS\"","lastUp":"2019-12-03T11:58:02.017+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
