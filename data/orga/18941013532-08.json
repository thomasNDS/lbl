(EPHA) is an international non-profit association (association international sans but lucratif, AISBL) registered in Belgium.  Our membership is composed of not-for-profit organizations working on all aspects of public health.  We disseminate information to our members on health-related EU policy and legislative initiatives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPHA's mission is to bring together the public health community to provide thought leadership and facilitate change; to build public health capacity to deliver equitable solutions to European public health challenges, to improve health and reduce health inequalities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our vision is of a Europe with universal good health and well-being, where all have access to a sustainable and high quality health system: A Europe whose policies and practices contribute to health, both within and beyond its borders.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPHA is committed to transparency about EU interest representation.  EPHA supports the aims and recommendations of Alter-EU to further improve transparency, as described here: https://www.alter-eu.org/what-we-want&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We therefore follow the Alter-EU guidelines when completing and updating the Register entry, as described here: https://www.alter-eu.org/documents/2012/04/transparency-register-guidelines","acronym":"EPHA","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Food Safety, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Under the EU Treaty, the EU can take action to protect and improve public health, prevent diseases, and identify (cross-border) threats to human health, while fully respecting the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and health care.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As well as EU action in health policy and in the EU Health Programme, many other EU policies and programmes have an impact on health and health systems. Most obviously these include Industrial policies (pharmaceuticals, food, tobacco, polluting industries and products, etc.), Agricultural policy, R&amp;D, Environment, Economic and Employment policies. EPHA adheres to the Governance for Health approach, which means that health impacts should be considered in the impact assessment process for all policy and programme proposals. Regrettably, health impact assessment requirements and guidelines are rarely adhered to in practice.","lastUp":"2019-05-06T14:41:34.991+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
