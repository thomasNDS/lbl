It was founded in 1946, shortly after World War II, with the belief that only a European Federation, based on the idea of unity in diversity, could overcome the division of the European continent that had caused the suffering and destruction of the two World Wars. Federalists believed that only a common effort of European citizens working towards this goal could create a peaceful and democratic Europe guaranteeing freedom and the protection of human rights.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The aim of the Union of European Federalists is therefore to bring together citizens  who desire to work for the federal unity of Europe, to act as a catalyst of democratic forces in Europe and to stimulate public debate on the political content of the 'European project'.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Members of our organisation come from all over Europe and are of all age groups and backgrounds. They all share a common concern about the future of Europe and of the European Union.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Not being affiliated to any political party, UEF is an autonomous political movement. It cooperates with and seeks to influence European, national and local institutions, parties and associations. Among its supporters are decision -makers from a wide political spectrum, which allows the UEF to influence daily politics of the European Union more effectively. UEF cooperates with the Young European Federalists (JEF), the European Movement, the World Federalist Movement and other pro-European organisations, which share similar concern about the future of Europe.","acronym":"UEF","interests":"Banking and financial services, Borders and Security, Budget, Communication, Culture, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Single market, Taxation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"European institutional affairs including reform of the institutional set-up of the Union within and beyond the current scope of the Treaties.
