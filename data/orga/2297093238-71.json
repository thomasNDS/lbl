It represents over 80% of the European automotive outbound logistics industry, distributing finished vehicles by road, rail, sea and inland waterways. Member-companies are responsible for the movement and post-production modification of such vehicles after they leave the factory and before they arrive at the franchised dealership. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Today ECG members come from 28 countries accross Europe - including Norway, Switzerland, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Western Balkans and Turkey - and have an aggregate direct turnover of around €27.1bn, employing more than 116,000 people. They own or operate 508 car-carrying ships, 16,000 purpose-built railway wagons, 25 river barges and 22,134 specialist road transporters. (Source: ECG Survey of Vehicle Logistics in Europe 2016/17)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ECG’s objective is to promote the interests of the finished vehicle logistics sector by highlighting its role as a vital and essential link in the automotive supply chain. Its task is to monitor current and future EU policies, internally discuss with members important developments affecting the sector and, if deemed necessary, to lobby European institutions so that its needs are recognized and taken into account in the EU policy making process.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ECG also provides information, training and networking events to its members and liaises, on behalf of its membership, with vehicle manufacturers (OEMs), their trade associations and other EU and international organisations.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The ECG Secretariat is based in Brussels and is run by an Executive Director. From the membership a President and Vice-President are elected and are supported by a Board consisting of members representing the geographical spread of the membership. The ECG President is elected for a term of two years, whilst Board members are elected every year.","acronym":"ECG","interests":"Climate Action, Competition, Customs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Information Society, Internal Market, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"The 2010 EU Transport White Paper and ensuing regulatory developments in the fields of Logistics, Road, Rail and Maritime Transport.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />More specifically:&#xd;<br />- 1st Mobility Package (published in May 2017)&#xd;<br />- Weights &amp; Dimensions (Directive 2015/719)&#xd;<br />- Electronic Transport Documents (e-CMR)&#xd;<br />- Secure Truck Parking Areas&#xd;<br />- Internal Market for Road Freight Transport&#xd;<br />- TEN-T &amp; CEF&#xd;<br />- Low Sulphur in Marine Fuels Directive &amp; SECAs&#xd;<br />- Digitalisation and decarbonisation","lastUp":"2018-04-13T19:13:52.072+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
