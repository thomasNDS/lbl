A key driver of economic growth, innovation is required to fill the multiple technology, design and business model gaps in the current plastic value chain as it transitions into a system that works. Discussions with a broad range of industry stakeholders and participants in the Ellen MacArthur’s New Plastics Economy initiative have identified innovation priorities in all segments of the plastics value chain for packaging. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Other vertical markets with sizeable plastic footprint are Packaging, Agriculture, Healthcare, Transportation and Construction. Each of these markets has indicated an interest in transitioning towards a circular economy, which in turn drives their own need for innovation in their own priority areas.&#xd;<br />Meeting the needs of these markets requires a robust, thriving innovation eco-system with hundreds, then thousands of early stage innovators who compete, grow and outperform each other, gradually increasing in quality, breadth and value. Developing and growing a robust innovation eco-system has multiple benefits:&#xd;<br />•\tAccelerate the pace of discovery and innovation in priority areas of the New Plastics Economy;&#xd;<br />•\tDe-risk corporate investment in R&amp;D, innovation and prototyping; &#xd;<br />•\tSupport the development of commercially viable prototypes meeting industry specifications; and&#xd;<br />•\tSupport and strengthen the innovation engine, securing the future pipeline;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The innovation eco-system for plastics has three key stakeholders who exist in a synergistic relationship: innovators, industry and investors. Their interdependency is mutually reinforcing, but each of them have unique needs and challenges. &#xd;<br />To meet these needs, Think Beyond Plastic is operating an Innovation Center which supports the needs of three key stakeholders: innovators, investors and industry. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Innovation Center is cultivating a robust innovation pipeline for all areas of the circular economy for plastics. Towards this goal, it is focused on growing and strengthening the innovation eco-system specifically by meeting the needs of innovators, investors and industry. Its structure incorporates an Innovation Hub and Regional User Facilities. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Innovation Hub has dedicated portals for innovators, industry and investors. The network of Regional User Facilities was launched in 2018. Planned expansion for 2019+ includes geographies with strategic relevance to the circular economy for plastics. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Currently, the Innovation Hub identifies and assesses 200+ early stage innovations, leveraging its global network of partners and institutions, and innovation challenges. It trains up to 30 startups and produces an annual Innovation Showcase and Investor Forum. The Regional User Facilities will substantially expand these capacities with wider access to innovation and support for qualified innovators. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Regional User Facilities offer access to equipment for testing, experimentation, prototyping and scalability, MVP development, design and packaging. Some facilities (opening in 2019) will offer special areas of expertise – i.e. cellulose, biomaterials, green chemistry etc. The network has a planned expansion in SE Asia, GCC, South America and two locations in Europe. The expansion of the network will provide essential support to the raising wave of global innovators and will substantially increase the flow of regional innovation.","acronym":"TBP","interests":"Competition, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"EU Plastics Initiative, Marine plastics and Waste management&#xd;<br />EU Chemicals, Human health and biodiversity initiatives&#xd;<br />Circular economy initiatives&#xd;<br />Horizons 2020&#xd;<br />Sustainable Chemistry initiatives","lastUp":"2019-08-28T21:52:00.797+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
