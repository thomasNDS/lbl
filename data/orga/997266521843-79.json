These can be efficiently addressed only through an integrated, collaborative and responsible approach. Enhanced cooperation and coordination between various stakeholders in the region and across sectors including those of the sea -given that the sea has always been the common space between the people of the region-, will give the necessary leverage to sustainable economic development.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The “Maritime Institute of Eastern Mediterranean” aims through its work to benefit this Region by addressing Maritime issues of regional interest through an intra-regional and cross-sectional cooperation and coordination and on the basis of the values of mutuality, sincerity, and transparency.
