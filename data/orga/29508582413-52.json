Launched in March 2007, the EGBA promotes the implementation of a competitive, fair and European regulated market accessible to operators applying high-level standards with regard to consumer and minor protection as well as other aspects of responsible gaming. The EGBA believes that consumers should have access to a greater choice of regulated European operators and access to the highest possible standards in protection and care, which is more likely to be achieved through regulated competition than in a monopoly environment.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EGBA groups the leading cross-border online gaming and betting operators fully established and licensed in Europe, several of which are publicly listed. All the members  of EGBA abide by strict standards that include:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-KYC and the prevention of underage or problem gambling; &#xd;<br />-A zero tolerance approach to fraud or criminal behavior &#xd;<br />strict safeguards for client privacy and security of information &#xd;<br />- Prompt payment policies&#xd;<br />- Rigorous and independent assessment of games fairness &#xd;<br />- Responsible and ethical marketing practice &#xd;<br />- Efficient and professional business conduct and a commitment to customer satisfaction and support.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />These standards do not replace the existing legal requirements already imposed by various EU licensing jurisdictions but are additional to these requirements and are compulsory to all EGBA members.","acronym":"EGBA","interests":"Business and Industry, Competition, Consumers, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Fraud prevention, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Single market, Sport, Taxation","euInitiatives":"Online gambling and all policies related to gambling, (Digital) single market, advertising, anti-money laundering, consumer protection, data protection, electronic ID, e-privacy, FinTech, internet policy, online payments etc.","lastUp":"2020-01-13T10:14:59.233+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
