Included within the scope of the ITU work are communication services such as the amateur radio and the amateur-satellite services. The Radiocommunication Sector of the ITU (ITU-R) manages the international radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbit resources. One of the primary activities of the IARU is to work within the ITU structure to preserve and maintain the spectrum allocated to the amateur radio and amateur-satellite services and to promote the usefulness and value of amateur radio. IARU attends all ITU-R meetings that may have any impact on amateur radio. In addition to being a sector member of ITU-R, the IARU also is a sector member of the Development Sector of ITU, or ITU-D. Emergency communications, disaster planning and response are topics discussed in ITU-D and IARU participates in those discussions. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />For more information see here: http://www.iaru.org/","acronym":"IARU-R1","interests":"Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Energy, Environment, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Sport, Trade, Youth","euInitiatives":"EMC Directive, Radio Equipment Directive, Consumer Protection, Spectrum Management, Civil Protection, RSPG","lastUp":"2019-05-24T00:17:37.640+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
