This international e-infrastructure has delivered unprecedented data analysis capabilities to more than 38,000 researchers from many disciplines. The federation brings together more than 350 data and compute centres worldwide. &#xd;<br />Today, EGI provides both technical and human services, from integrated and secure distributed high-throughput and cloud computing, storage and data resources to consultancy, support and co-development.&#xd;<br />The research supported by EGI is diverse . Examples include the search for the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator at CERN; finding new tools to diagnose and monitor diseases such as Alzheimer’s, or the development of complex simulations to model climate change. For the research communities, the benefits of EGI are:&#xd;<br />1.\tEnsuring uniform and reliable availability of resources to researchers on a local, national and European scale&#xd;<br />2.\tEnabling faster production of scientific results through collaboration across organisational and national boundaries &#xd;<br />3.\tPromoting open and collaborative science and ensuring open access to shared resources and expertise&#xd;<br />4.\tAllowing researchers to focus on their research rather than managing their e-infrastructure needs&#xd;<br />5.\tProviding effective utilisation of resources in different administrative domains to ensure the most effective return on infrastructure investments&#xd;<br />6.\tFacilitating the innovation and sharing of solutions by building a thriving ecosystem through community events and collaborative services.","acronym":"EGI Foundation","interests":"Digital economy and society, Environment, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"H2020 with a specific focus on the European Cloud Initiative, including the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and the European Data Infrastructure (EDI), Research Infrastructures, Procurement, Funding Mechanisms and Instruments","lastUp":"2019-06-11T15:58:49.808+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
