JUUL was founded by former smokers, James Monsees and Adam Bowen. We envision a world where fewer people use cigarettes, and where people who smoke cigarettes have the tools to reduce or eliminate their consumption entirely, should they so desire. As scientists, product designers and engineers, we believe that vaping can have a positive impact when used by smokers, and can have a negative impact when used by nonsmokers. Our goal is to maximize the positive and reduce the negative.","acronym":"","interests":"Business and Industry, Consumers, Customs, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"We follow initiatives that can impact on our ability to fulfil our mission.
