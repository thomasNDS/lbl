Considering the growing religious radicalization in the region and all over the world, GCJH understands that promoting interfaith dialogue, social cohesion and active citizenship is crucial to ensure future generations democracy, peace and inclusiveness. Therefore, GCJH wants to play a catalytic role in facilitating such dialogue through a holistic approach that may recognize the interdependence between the law, universal values, tolerance , interfaith  and political commitment. All its activities and projects take into account the importance of women and youth’s empowerment and make them key actors of the above process to the benefit of all humanity.","acronym":"GCJH","interests":"Culture, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Environment, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Youth","euInitiatives":"GCJH follows a range of EU initiatives related to the protection and promotion of human rights at internal and external level.
