It was founded in 1988 to represent companies that specialise in the production and supply of high quality natural animal proteins. These are valued ingredients in food products, in feeds for farm animals and pets and in aquaculture feeds. They also fulfil important roles in many pharmaceutical products. Animal proteins offer an excellent way of retaining the value from by-products of the meat processing industry that otherwise would be treated as less valuable applications.","acronym":"EAPA","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Consumers, Food Safety, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health","euInitiatives":"EAPA represents all the animal protein producers in Europe.
