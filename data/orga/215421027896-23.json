EMEC is at the forefront in the development of international standards for marine energy, and is forging alliances with other countries, exporting its knowledge around the world to stimulate the development of a global marine renewables industry.","acronym":"EMEC","interests":"Energy, Environment","euInitiatives":"European Commission Strategic Energy Technology Plan&#xd;<br />European Commission Ocean Energy Roadmap&#xd;<br />European Commission Blue Energy - Action needed to deliver on the potential of ocean energy in European seas and oceans by 2020 and beyond","lastUp":"2018-08-01T15:55:17.950+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
