This work includes monitoring and lobbying among EU decision makers, as well as working closely with African artisanal fishing organizations. Most importantly, CFFA works closely with member organizations of the African Confederation of Artisanal Fishing organisations (CAOPA), and with the African media network REJOPRAO. The role of CFFA has been to provide information and support to assist these organizations to become established and have a stronger voice, in particular in European policy dialogues with African countries. CFFA maintains a information site, which has been important for informing both stakeholders in Africa and in Europe.","acronym":"CFFA","interests":"Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries","euInitiatives":"EU Fisheries Policy&#xd;<br />EU Development Policy&#xd;<br />EU (fish) Trade Policy","lastUp":"2019-07-15T15:39:35.605+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
