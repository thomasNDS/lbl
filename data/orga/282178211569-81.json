It coordinates activities on renewable resources throughout Germany according to the guidelines of the R&amp;D Funding programme for Renewable Resources. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />FNR is also involved in respective activities on European and international level. The use of renewable resources is not only a big topic in Germany, but more or less worldwide. Many other countries are quite active in this area termed the \"Bioeconomy\", since there is a global need to use resources in a more sustainable way. In order to accelerate this development, coordination of respective efforts play an important role for using synergies and avoiding overlaps across national boundaries. FNR aims to contribute to the needed coordination and knowledge transfer and has actively been participating in various trans-national projects and international cooperations for several years.","acronym":"FNR","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Energy, Environment, Research and innovation, Transport","euInitiatives":"EU 2020 Strategy&#xd;<br />EU Climate Policy Framework 2020/30&#xd;<br />EU 2030 Energy Strategy&#xd;<br />EU Bioeconomy Strategy&#xd;<br />Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking Public-Private Partnership&#xd;<br />SET-Plan&#xd;<br />ETIP Bioenergy&#xd;<br />Amendments FQD/RED&#xd;<br />RED II&#xd;<br />LULUCF&#xd;<br />Circular Economy","lastUp":"2019-03-19T13:42:21.782+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
