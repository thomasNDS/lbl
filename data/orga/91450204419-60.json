Our clients are Fortune 500 companies or campaign groups. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our focus is to help build public policy into the business planning processes. For some clients, policy issues may be peripheral. In other cases, they can be business critical. We work with clients to move beyond communications to wider planning, to ensure that they prepare for future change before their competitors, and contribute to the policy debate in advance of legislation. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Lobbying:  In general, we work as overall advisors to our clients, engaging other agencies for implementation as needed. In certain cases, however, we also support the advocacy work of our clients directly. Currently lobbying represents less than 10% of our turnover.
