Together we have working relationships with DG GROW.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nEUCC is member of the ECNC Group, consisting of ECNC-European Centre for Nature Conservation, Coastal &amp; Marine Union – EUCC, and the EUCC MedCentre. The Group offers an additional network to facilitate access to European institutions.&#xd;\n\t&#xd;\nEUCC is a founding member of the European Habitats Forum (EHF), a coalition of NGOs advising DG Environment on habitats and Natura 2000 issues. We are now connected to the EHF through the ECNC Group.","goal":"Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC) is a stakeholder and network association with members in 40 countries. Founded in 1989 with the aim of promoting a European approach to coastal conservation by bridging the gap between scientists, environmentalists, site managers, planners and policy makers, it has grown since then into the largest network of coastal and marine practitioners and experts in Europe and neighbouring areas.&#xd;<br />EUCC is dedicated to conserving and maintaining healthy seas and attractive coasts for both people and nature. To this end, EUCC seeks to:&#xd;<br />◦promote integrated marine and coastal management, combining development with the protection of biodiversity, social, historical and cultural values;&#xd;<br />◦work to limit the impacts of climate change;&#xd;<br />◦provide advice, information, communication and policy instruments;&#xd;<br />◦partake in coastal and marine research projects;&#xd;<br />◦raise awareness of environmental issues;&#xd;<br />◦develop partnerships with stakeholders.","acronym":"EUCC","interests":"Climate Action, Communication, Digital economy and society, Environment, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Regional Policy, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"BLUE GROWTH: Integrated Coastal Management / Maritime Spatial Planning:&#xd;<br />Coastal policy’s formulation and implementation is the raison d’être for EUCC. Our experience and network knowledge base intends to provide support towards meeting the newly adopted MSP Directive requirement of ‘land-sea interactions’:&#xd;<br />◦EUCC aim to continue supporting the (further) development and implementation of MSP, with particular attention to the land-sea interactions within the EU and neighbouring countries, especially at regional seas level. We believe that over 20 years of ICM experience can be best applied to the implementation of the EU MSP Directive and to further support the ICM/MSP Group of Experts. This goal is especially relevant regarding governance and stakeholder engagement for better co-ordination.&#xd;<br />◦Since its creation, EUCC is a member of the EU ICM Expert Group (former ICZM) and actively participates in meetings of the EU ICZM Expert Group and recently during the Joint ICM/MSP Expert Groups meetings. Following the process towards a legal ICM/MSP instrument, EUCC released a Position Paper for the Integration of Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) and Maritime Spatial Planning Directive (2014).&#xd;<br />◦EUCC aims to ensure that MSP will learn from the experience of ICM principles applied to coastal management in order to avoid the risk of poor connectivity between terrestrial &amp; maritime planning which ultimately may slow down planning, risking poor and unsustainable decisions. In order to achieve this, we will mobilise our members through the EUCC Thematic Expert Group (TEG) “Land-Sea Interactions to support MSP” (formed in September 2014), that consists of a core group of international experts from various EU member states that jointly will address these issue by providing advice and liaising with relevant experts throughout coastal Europe.&#xd;<br />◦At the Regional Seas level, EUCC has been following and contributing to the work as observer of the OSPAR and HELCOM Conventions, as well as following closely the Black Sea and Mediterranean regional seas developments. Its EUCC Mediterranean Centre is UNEP MAP Partner.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />MARINE STRATEGY: The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) target to achieve ‘good environmental status’ by 2020 is coming under severe pressure. Since the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive has started, EUCC has been actively involved in the implementation process and, in particular, contributing to several key EU projects and integration in the MSFD Underwater Noise and Marine Litter Technical Subgroups, which have been set-up to provide guidance and recommendations to the MSFD-GES Working Group in respect to these two descriptors.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />GREEN COASTS; &#xd;<br />Climate Change Adaptation:&#xd;<br />In recent years, EUCC has paid much attention to adaptation measures necessary for living with the effects of the environmental impacts of ocean warming and acidification and its negative impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems; and of accelerated sea level rise, increasing frequency and intensity of storms, tidal surges, resulting into coastal erosion and poorly designed coastal defence strategies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Sustainable development:&#xd;<br />In 2013, the European Commission has launched the European Tourism Indicator System (ETIS) for Sustainable Management of Destinations. All ETIS indicators are now included in the EUCC's QualityCoast programme. In addition, QualityCoast is also in compliance with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC, established by UN WTO and UNEP). QualityCoast is closely connected to the Global Sustainable Tourism Review (GSTR) – a new Destination Sustainability Support System that makes the GSTC and the ETIS indicators operational towards the tourism sector.","lastUp":"2018-10-02T14:34:39.129+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
