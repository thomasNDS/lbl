The ESSDE is a key contributor to and influencer of European education policy. During a meeting of Ministers in charge of Vocational Education and Training, European Social Partners and the European Commission in Riga in June 2015, Michael Moriarty, as President of EFEE, signed a joint pledge with ETUCE representatives on apprenticeships.&#xd;<br />With the pledge, EFEE and ETUCE wish to:&#xd;<br />* improve the esteem, image and quality of VET and apprenticeships&#xd;<br />* improve social dialogue on this issue at European and national level, and&#xd;<br />* improve cooperation between schools and companies on organisation and quality assurance of apprenticeships and work-­based learning.&#xd;<br />The pledge underlines EFEE’s and ETUCE’s commitment to enhance the work of their organisations and the joint activities in the framework of the European Sectoral Social Dialogue in Education to further contribute to the implementation of the goals of the European Alliance for Apprenticeships.&#xd;<br />At the same meeting, organised by the Latvian Presidency, Ministers from the EU, Candidate Countries and the EEA Countries endorsed the “Riga Conclusions” on a new set of priorities to improve Vocational Education and Training for the period of 2015-2020. &#xd;<br />ETBI, through its membership of EFEE, is involved in a significant European research project jointly led by European Centre of Employers and Enterprises providing Public services (CEEP) and EFEE.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The aim of the project is to generate European policy recommendations regarding how the competences provided by education and training institutions might better meet the competence requirement of public service employers in Europe.&#xd;<br />Focusing on public service sectors such as education and training, health care, public transport, energy and public administration, national VET associations and intermediary bodies, and other stakeholders from the world of education and work, the project is mapping the current and future competence needs, documenting the competences that education and training providers claim to provide to prospective public servants and identifying the competence gap and the good practice that public service employers and others implement to bridge that gap. &#xd;<br />ETBI is also a founder member of EUproVET, a representational platform for European VET providers which addresses education policy issues at EU level.","lastUp":"2019-03-22T15:08:02.030+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
