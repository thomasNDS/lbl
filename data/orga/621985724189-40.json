We are the region’s leading network of feminist organizations and advocates. Our 248 members represent groups of diverse women from 27 countries in the Asia Pacific. APWLD’s strength lies in the diversity, experience, expertise and commitment the members bring to the organization. Established in 1986 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, APWLD has been actively advocating for women’s human rights for 30 years. The secretariat relocated to Chiang Mai, Thailand in 1997.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />APWLD fosters feminist movements in the Asia Pacific to impact policies and practices at the local, national, regional, and international level. We develop capacities, produce and disseminate feminist analyses, conduct advocacy, and foster networks and spaces for movement building to claim and strengthen women’s human rights. We also empower women in the region to use the law as an instrument of change for equality, justice, peace, and development.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />APWLD’s current strategic plan (2017-2021) is focused on advancing development justice across our programmes and the diverse platforms that we engage as well as on building movements of women’s rights advocates at grassroots, regional, and international levels. This focus is based on the conclusion of our last external review, which found that APWLD “is most effective when it mobilizes these networks across specific policies and platforms and amplifies marginalized voices in the policymaking arena.” We also draw on recent research demonstrating that the existence of strong and autonomous feminist and women’s movements is a key determinant in progressive policymaking.  The five-year plan aims to amplify our successes and strengthen the four domains identified in our theory of change: capacity, analysis, advocacy, and movements. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our overarching goals for APWLD’s current strategic planning period are: &#xd;<br />1.\tTo build and strengthen feminist movements at local, national, and regional levels particularly of the most marginalized;&#xd;<br />2.\tTo amplify the influence, impact, and voice of Asia Pacific women in global and regional policy setting bodies to transform international, regional, and national norms, standards, and frameworks to be more just, sustainable, and rights-based;&#xd;<br />3.\tTo facilitate the production of evidence-based research and tools for advocacy outcomes and movement building; and&#xd;<br />4.\tTo build the capacity of women’s rights organizations and activists in the region to use rights-based perspectives and to interrogate the intersections of patriarchy, globalization, fundamentalism, and militarization.","acronym":"APWLD","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"APWLD as an regional movement committed to advocating and advancing women's human rights in the region recognizes EU's commitment to gender inclusive development.
