This support takes the form of legal, medical and social emergency assistance, submitting complaints to regional and international human rights mechanisms and urgent interventions.&#xd;<br />OMCT pays particular attention to certain categories of victims, such as women and children.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Preventing torture and fighting against impunity:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Together with its local partners, OMCT advocates for the effective implementation, on the ground, of international standards against torture.&#xd;<br />OMCT is also working for the optimal use of international human rights mechanisms, in particular the United Nations Committee Against Torture, so that it can become more effective.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Protecting human rights defenders:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Often those who defend human rights and fight against torture are threatened. That is why OMCT places their protection at the heart of its mission, through alerts, activities of prevention, advocacy and awareness-raising as well as direct support.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Accompanying and strengthening organisations in the field:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />OMCT provides its members with the tools and services that enable them to carry out their work and strengthen their capacity and effectiveness in the fight against torture.&#xd;<br />OMCT presence in Tunisia is part of its commitment to supporting civil society in the process of transition to the rule of law and respect for the absolute prohibition of torture.","acronym":"OMCT","interests":"Borders and Security, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy","euInitiatives":"OMCT Europe’s main goal is to appeal for a more coherent and effective European human rights policy. At the internal level, it advocates for the EU to integrate the various international human rights norms into its legislation. At the external level, OMCT Europe appeals for the creation of a control mechanism on Union activities and the measures it adopts. This double requirement aims to ensure a real coherence in the EU’s external policy so that respect for human rights is recognised as an essential element for peace and security, and that it becomes incontrovertible at all levels of the EU’s foreign policy.
