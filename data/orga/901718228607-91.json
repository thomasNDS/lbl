The Instituto de Astrofísica, the headquarters, which is in La Laguna (Tenerife).&#xd;<br />-. The Centro de Astrofísica en La Palma (CALP)&#xd;<br />-. The Observatorio del Teide (OT), in Izaña (Tenerife).&#xd;<br />-. The Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos (ORM), in Garafía (La Palma).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The IAC is constituted administratively as a Public Consortium, created by statute in 1982, with involvement from the Spanish Government, the Government of the Canary Islands, the University of La Laguna and Spain's Science Research Council (CSIC).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The International Scientific Committee (CCI) manages participation in the observatories by institutions from other countries. A Time Allocation Committee (CAT) allocates the observing time reserved for Spain at the telescopes in the IAC's observatories.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The exceptional quality of the sky over the Canaries for astronomical observations is protected by law. The IAC's Sky Quality Protection Office (OTPC) regulates the application of the law and its Sky Quality Group continuously monitors the parameters that define observing quality at the IAC Observatories.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The IAC's mission is to perform excellent research and technological developments in astrophysics, securing the appropriate training of graduate students, young researchers and engineers, promoting outreach and technology transfer in many different areas and fostering a fruitful and stable environment of international collaboration. Its vision is focused in the consolidation of International leadership in Astrophysics and Space Sciences, by delivering excellent scientific and technological outcomes, strengthening the “astronomical reserve” of the Observatorios de Canarias (OOCC), and promoting the transfer of knowledge between scientific communities and society.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The IAC's research programme includes astrophysical research and technological development projects.&#xd;<br />The IAC is also involved in researcher training, university teaching and outreach activities.","acronym":"IAC","interests":"Communication, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Environment, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"-.
