In the spirit of multi-stakeholder collaboration, OGP is overseen by a Steering Committee including representatives of governments and civil society organizations.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />To become a member of OGP, participating countries and localities must endorse a high-level Open Government Declaration, deliver a country action plan developed with public consultation, and commit to independent reporting on their progress going forward.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Open Government Partnership formally launched on September 20, 2011, when the 8 founding governments (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, the Philippines, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States) endorsed the Open Government Declaration, and announced their country action plans. Since 2011, OGP has welcomed the commitment of 88 additional national and local governments to join the Partnership.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In total, 76 OGP participating countries and 20 subnational governments have made over 2,500 commitments to make their governments more open and accountable.","acronym":"OGP","interests":"Banking and financial services, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, European Neighbourhood Policy, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Fraud prevention, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"Our main interaction with the EU institution is to share information regarding OGP member countries and EU members and their progress in OGP.
