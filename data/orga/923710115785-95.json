Wherever possible, TPN works with established organisations and institutions, avoiding duplication and enhancing specific objectives.&#xd;<br />TPN does not itself take positions on specific issues nor represent specific interests.","acronym":"TPN","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Consumers, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Trade, Transport","euInitiatives":"Fields of Interest:&#xd;<br />Agriculture&#xd;<br />Climate Action&#xd;<br />Economic Affairs&#xd;<br />Energy&#xd;<br />Environment&#xd;<br />External trade&#xd;<br />Foreign and Security Policy&#xd;<br />Information Society&#xd;<br />Transport&#xd;<br />Audiovisual and media&#xd;<br />Competition&#xd;<br />Enlargement&#xd;<br />General Institutional Affairs&#xd;<br />Internal market&#xd;<br />Consumer Affairs&#xd;<br />Development&#xd;<br />Enterprise&#xd;<br />External Relations&#xd;<br />Justice and Home affairs&#xd;<br />Research and technology","lastUp":"2019-03-20T15:50:15.419+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
