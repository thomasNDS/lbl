In responding to HIV, the EATG will also consider diseases frequently seen as co-infections in persons living with HIV, as well as other health issues that increase the risk of HIV infection. &#xd;<br />The primary geographic focus of the EATG is the member states served by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe; however, the EATG will consider opportunities to collaborate with and support similar efforts in other parts of the world.&#xd;<br />History:&#xd;<br />The European AIDS Treatment Group (EATG) is a patient-led NGO that advocates for the rights and interests of people living with or affected by HIV/ AIDS and related co-infections within the WHO Europe region. &#xd;<br />Founded in 1992, the EATG is a network of more than 180 nationally-based members from 47 countries in Europe. Since its foundation, the EATG has been at the forefront of the development of the civil society response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Europe and has been defending the treatment-related interests of people living with HIV/AIDS and related co-infections such as Hepatitis C and Tuberculosis. &#xd;<br />Our members are PLHIV and representatives of different communities affected by HIV/AIDS and co-infections. EATG represents the diversity of more than 2.3 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Europe as well as those affected by HIV/AIDS and co-infections.&#xd;<br />Our activities focus on treatment literacy and treatment advocacy.&#xd;<br />Access to the best available treatments is a major goal for the EATG. This includes:&#xd;<br />•\tAccess for all people who could benefit from the treatment, including so-called key-populations like people using drugs, women, children &amp; youth, migrants, prisoners, people with hepatitis or tuberculosis co-infection, and other. &#xd;<br />•\tAccess for patients in all stages of HIV infection (including first-line and salvage treatment options) &#xd;<br />•\tAccess to treatment in all European countries (according to the WHO definition of the European region)&#xd;<br />Goals and objectives:&#xd;<br />•\tTo enable people with HIV or at risk of HIV infection, and their advocates, to provide significant input into the process of developing, testing and approving HIV treatments&#xd;<br />•\tTo advocate for best practices of care and treatment for all persons living with HIV/AIDS&#xd;<br />•\tTo advocate for the rapid introduction of established and new HIV and co-infection (hepatitis and TB) treatments, medical devices &amp; products and diagnostic tests&#xd;<br />•\tTo promote the availability of appropriate information about HIV, Hepatitis and TB treatments for people with HIV, health care providers, and health policy makers&#xd;<br />•\tTo advocate for changes in legislation and patent law, and for the medical evaluation of generic medicines that would promote the availability of lower-cost HIV treatments&#xd;<br />•\tTo advocate for changes in legislation and policies affecting the health, rights and quality of life of people living with HIV","acronym":"EATG","interests":"Education and training, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"The EU HIV/AIDS Civil Society Forum has been established by the European Commission as an informal working group to facilitate the participation of non-governmental organizations, including those representing people living with HIV/AIDS in policy development and implementation and in information-exchange activities. The CSF includes about 40 organizations from all over Europe. AIDS Action Europe (AAE) and EATG co-chair and provide support to the work of the EU HIV/AIDS Civil Society Forum, an informal advisory body to the European Commission.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The European Testing Week is an initiative that was launched by HIV in Europe in 2013 to help more people to become aware of their HIV status. &#xd;<br />Initiative aims: The ultimate goal of European HIV-Hepatitis Testing Week is to make more people aware of their HIV and/ or hepatitis status and reduce late diagnosis by communicating the benefits of testing with the aim of supporting ongoing dialogue between all partners in the HIV, and hepatitis communities.","lastUp":"2019-05-22T12:03:00.328+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
