As a European patient-led advocacy organisation, it has been at the forefront of the development of the civil society response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Europe. It represents and defends the treatment-related interests of people living with HIV and AIDS.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EATG is a voluntary organisation made up of over 150 members from over 45 different European countries. Our members are representatives of different communities affected by HIV/AIDS in Europe. Our activities focus on treatment activism and treatment advocacy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In responding to HIV, the EATG also considers diseases frequently seen as co-infection in people with HIV, as well as other health issues that increase the risk of HIV. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EATG’s primary geographic focus is the member states served by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Office for Europe. However, the EATG does consider opportunities to collaborate with and support similar efforts in other parts of the world.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />goals&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1. To enable people with HIV or at risk of HIV infection and their supporters to significantly influence the development, testing and approving of HIV treatments. In this context, HIV treatment means medical devices, products and diagnostic tests that prevent or treat HIV infection and include continuous improvement in the quality of life of people affected. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. To advocate for the best practices of care and treatment.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />3. To advocate for rapidly available existing and new HIV treatment.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />4. To promote the access of the latest available information about treatment legislation for patients, health care providers as well as policy makers.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />5. To influence changes in legislation and patent law in order to support the lowest achievable cost for HIV treatment, including the support for generic medicine.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />6. To monitor the changes in Health care systems and policies to ensure the rights and the quality of services influence positively the quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS.","acronym":"EATG","interests":"Education and training, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"The EU HIV/AIDS Civil Society Forum has been established by the European Commission as an informal working group to facilitate the participation of non-governmental organizations, including those representing people living with HIV/AIDS in policy development and implementation and in information-exchange activities.
