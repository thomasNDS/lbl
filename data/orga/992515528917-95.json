The role of EETS Providers is new and therefore parties interested in providing that role in the future will need to found their own representation group.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />This resulted in 9 European companies, specialized in the payment of tolling (card and OBU issuing) &amp; fuelling in the European region (the founding members), acting on the idea of creating, as potential EETS Providers, a non-profit-making Association with the goal of representing its members as a stakeholder group with regard to the definition of the EETS Provider role as stipulated within the EU legal framework: AETIS - Association of Electronic Toll and Interoperable Services.","acronym":"AETIS","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Consumers, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"- Review of Directive 2004/52/EC and Decision 2009/750/EC on the interoperability of European electronic toll systems&#xd;<br />- Review of the Eurovignette Directive&#xd;<br />- EU initiatives on road charging, C-ITS, mobility (including Mobility Packages), road transport, etc.","lastUp":"2018-06-20T14:29:29.836+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
