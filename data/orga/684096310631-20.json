In addition, its social and the cultural activities focused on EU issues represent an important part of its activities as an Aisbl. The context is that of the dialogue between EU institutions on the one hand, and churches and religious associations or organisations on the other hand as legislated in the Treaty of Lisbon(Article 17, TFEU). They serve to promote the construction of Europe, and specifically of the European Union, grounded on social justice, peace and freedom. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In order to provide a space of reflection and exchange on the relevant European issues (such as European Values, Social Policy, Migrants, Human Dignity, Human Rights) and to promote a Christian perspective on European policy making, the staff of the Chapel for Europe monitors developments in the EU institutions. The perspective of the Chapel for Europe is the based on ethical values inspired by a Gospel, solidarity and in search of the common good.","acronym":"","interests":"Climate Action, Communication, Culture, Development, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Youth","euInitiatives":"Human Rights Issues&#xd;<br />Social Policies&#xd;<br />Youth Policies&#xd;<br />Dialogue between the EU Institutions and European&#xd;<br />Churches  and Religious Organisations Issues","lastUp":"2018-04-02T12:38:10.109+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
