It therefore represents a vast network of patients, doctors and scientists, and these stakeholders along with its industrial partners make it eminently suited to work in close partnership with the European Commission, the European Parliament and the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as other decision-making bodies. The EBC was officially founded on 22 March 2002 in Brussels, and has offices in Brussels.","acronym":"EBC","interests":"Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"Main dossiers EBC follows: Horizon 2020, preparations for Framework Programme 9, Comorbidity, Chronic and non-communicable diseases","lastUp":"2019-12-31T16:00:27.104+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
