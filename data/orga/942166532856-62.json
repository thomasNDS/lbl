Accordingly, it leads important international research and education networks, ensuring the integration of scientific findings into its graduate and post-graduate programmes.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />At the Italian level, in the international ranking of universities published by the Times Higher Education 2019, the University of Pisa ranks in the range between 8th and 11th place, out of a total of 43 institutions surveyed, confirming its position as the first among the generalist universities in Tuscany. The Departments of Information Engineering and of Civilisatios and Forms of Knowledge of the University, moreover, have recently obtained from the Italian Ministry of Research an important recognition, so-called Department of Excellence, for the quality of research and management of research activities.&#xd;<br />The quality of the research of the University of Pisa is also attested by a significant number of research projects funded by the European Framework Programmes (157 in FP7, and 97 so far in H2020), and in particular by the n. 8 ERC projects funded in FP7 and in Horizon 2020, in different research fields.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since 2017, UNIPI has strengthened its strategy to increase excellence in research and international competitiveness within the European and international scenario, by further developing its networking and lobbying activities at the EU level, launching specific actions and incentives and reinforcing the support services of its European and International Research Service. Further actions have been undertaken as well in disseminating information and raising awareness on the R&amp;I European policies and funding opportunities. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />UNIPI is member of several eureopean and international networks like EUA, Science|Business and UNIMED and is involved in many of the most important EU initiatives related to the Horizon 2020 framework program (e.g. the JTI Clean Sky, the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA), EuroMarine, the European Network of Materials Research Centres (ENMat), euRobotics, NetWorld2020 etc.). &#xd;<br />Of particular importance is the collaboration that has been active for about 6 years with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the implementation of joint research of the highest profile. &#xd;<br />Furthermore, UNIPI has important partnerships with Latin America, China, Central Asia, Northern Africa and the United States. UNIPI has currently more than 200 MoU with countries all over the world to promote and carry out activities related to teaching, research and training.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Innovation and technology transfer to the private sector and society are key points of the University’s mission. As a result, 33 spin-offs flourished since 2004, most of which still maintaining a formal relationship with the University, with around 100 national and international patents awarded.","acronym":"UNIPI","interests":"Agriculture, Banking and financial services, Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, European Neighbourhood Policy, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Fraud prevention, General and Institutional Affairs, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Migration and asylum, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"The University of Pisa is member of several eureopean and international networks like EUA, Science|Business and UNIMED and is involved in many of the most important EU initiatives related to the Horizon 2020 framework program, e.g. the JTI Clean Sky, EERA, ARTEMIS, JPI Facce, Ecsel, HiPEAC EuroMarine, ENMat, euRobotics, NetWorld2020 etc. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />UNIPI is memebr of the GARR network, the ultra-broadband network dedicated to the Italian research and education community.
