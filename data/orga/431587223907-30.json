Maintaining a healthy ocean requires responsible stewardship by all users.&#xd;<br />The ocean supports a growing range and level of commercial use and other activities. Concerns about the impacts of economic activity on ocean health from increasing use are on the rise. These concerns may limit industry access to marine areas and resources. Ocean users, including those who simply rely on shipping to move goods, are increasingly being held accountable by governments and NGOs for the state of the ocean. Continued ocean access and use will increasingly require the social license to operate - above and beyond simple regulatory compliance - and participation in Sustainable Development Goals.&#xd;<br />Many companies are working to reduce their marine ecosystem footprint. However, the best efforts by a single company or an entire sector will not be enough to address the cumulative impacts on the inter-connected marine ecosystem from growing use across the sectors. Companies dependent on the ocean can achieve business value from working with others in the ocean business community to address shared challenges regarding sustainable development, science and stewardship. &#xd;<br />The World Ocean Council is the only international, cross-sectoral industry leadership alliance on “Corporate Ocean Responsibility”.&#xd;<br />The WOC brings together the diverse ocean business community (shipping, fisheries, oil &amp; gas, aquaculture, offshore renewables, tourism, seabed mining, marine technology, manufacturers, law, retailers, insurers, finance, etc.) to achieve the business benefits of cross-sectoral leadership and collaboration. The WOC is developing global ‘platforms’ on important cross-cutting ocean business and sustainability challenges, e.g. ocean policy &amp; governance, marine planning, invasive species, marine debris, marine sound, marine mammal impacts, water pollution, data collection by industry vessels &amp; platforms, sea level rise/extreme event impacts on ports, priority regions (e.g. Arctic, Indian Ocean), and investment &amp; innovation for ocean sustainable development.&#xd;<br />Responsible ocean companies are invited join the growing number distinguishing themselves as leaders in “Corporate Ocean Responsibility” through the WOC.&#xd;<br />The WOC is the only international, multi-industry alliance for private sector leadership and collaboration in ocean sustainable development, science and stewardship.&#xd;<br />In addition to the 75+ WOC Members from the diverse ocean business community, the WOC Network includes 35,000+ ocean industry and media stakeholders around the world. The WOC is recognized or accredited by numerous U.N. agencies and other international organizations as the credible, global leadership body on ocean business and sustainability.","acronym":"WOC","interests":"Climate Action, Competition, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Food Safety, General and Institutional Affairs, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"The World Ocean Council has been following closely the development and/or implementation of the EU Horizon 2020 program","lastUp":"2018-03-28T18:35:37.099+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
