In 2002, the CCRN members came together to defend their common interests at EU level and voice the need for a distinct urban dimension in EU cohesion policy. Since then the CCRN has elaborated various positions concerning Cohesion Policy. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Capital cities and regions, because of their complexity, the role they play as motors of growth and the sub-regional disparities they face, are unquestionably laboratories for territorial cohesion. Capital Cities and Regions are at the forefront of cultural, economic, and political activity in the EU Member States. At the same time, they face social and economic disparities where extreme poverty, social exclusion and wealth coexist. Therefore, the CCRN considers that the EU and the MS must pay greater attention to its urban territories and their multifold functions and challenges in an integrated approach.","acronym":"CCRN","interests":"Economy, finance and the euro, General and Institutional Affairs, Regional Policy","euInitiatives":"Cohesion policy, Regional and urban development, Integrated territorial investments, Metropolitan areas","lastUp":"2018-10-24T11:39:57.259+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
