It was established as a network to provide the voice for the non-profit sector at the European level on specific issues which are common to all non-profit organisations and associations. For many years CEDAG has closely followed policy developments in the area of social policy, but over the last few years this focus area has been prioritised even further.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CEDAG’s members are national and regional umbrella bodies, involved in social fields of activities such as education, citizenship, culture, social and health issues, environmental issues, consumer protection and sport, uniting a big number of organisations with millions of members and, taking into account the informal networks with the new Member States, this number is likely to be multiplied.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />This specific membership group works actively on policy development in both the social policy and civil dialogue fields. CEDAG’s uniqueness is that it currently is the only European network which represents national overarching or sector-wide umbrellas and that it is mainly ran by its national members. This allows a quicker and more direct link to the national implementation of EU policy initiatives and in return concrete examples and input of the effects of EU policy on the local, regional and national level.CEDAG is neither linked to any political party or trade union, nor to any religion, nor to any public or private institution. It is basically pluralist, open to the world and very attached to democratic governance.","acronym":"CEDAG","interests":"Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Consumers, Culture, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Single market, Taxation, Youth","euInitiatives":"European semester&#xd;<br />Services of general interest&#xd;<br />Active Inclusion strategy&#xd;<br />Social investment package&#xd;<br />Social business initiative&#xd;<br />Poverty platform&#xd;<br />Civil dialogue&#xd;<br />Participatory democracy","lastUp":"2019-05-31T10:12:34.423+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
