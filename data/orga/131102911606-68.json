Its vision is to make Europe think young.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />OUR HISTORY&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2007, as students, we were working in Brussels for one of the biggest European student organisations.&#xd;<br />We often participated in conferences and debates where the only young people involved were the assistants or interns of Members of the European Parliament. Very few young people were actively involved in the debate regarding the development of Europe, nor were they mentioned as the subjects of studies and research projects that were presented.Our founders then decided to start an online think-tank where young people were asked, through surveys, what they thought about the future of European integration. They wanted to raise the voice of European youth. Our first office was opened in September 2009.Today we have a constantly growing workforce comprised of a diverse mix of cultures and nationalities, spread throughout our two locations in Brussels – Our Headquarters and our Research Center.We also have an extensive network of online personnel whom regularly help to advise and contribute to the policies of ThinkYoung.","acronym":"TY","interests":"Budget, Climate Action, Communication, Culture, Culture and media, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Research and innovation, Single market, Sport, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"Research activities on young people conditions, the education system, entrepreneurship framework, EU-Asia Relations and EU Enlargement and neighbour policy. &#xd;<br />We are currently following the public consultation on the new programs of the EU commission, green deal, digital revolution, makers movement and the circular/sharing/social economy.","lastUp":"2019-12-04T18:38:36.387+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"700000-799999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
