It acts as a think tank to discuss and debate key issues in digital policy and provides an umbrella organisation for a range of co-regulatory measures in the digital industry. We are calling for suitable regulatory methods to foster innovation and the digital transformation and, at the same time, promote corporate social responsibility, in particular with regard to the appropriate measures for data and consumer protection. The instruments here cover a spectrum from enhancing the transparency of services and data processing and strengthening best practices in digital security to binding voluntary commitments from industry underpinned by sanctions.","acronym":"SCOPE Europe","interests":"Business and Industry, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"DSM-Strategy&#xd;<br />GDPR&#xd;<br />Data Economy / Data Flows&#xd;<br />Privacy&#xd;<br />Community of Practice for better Self- and Co-Regulation","lastUp":"2019-10-29T15:18:21.183+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
