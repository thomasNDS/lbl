In excess of 80% of legislation, which has an impact on businesses within the Member States of the Union, is now initiated and approved at EU level.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />For many organisations the diverse and complex institutions of the EU are a mystery which absorbs precious time and resources. Organisations do recognise, however, the need to interact with the Council, the Commission and the Parliament. They must be able to participate in debates before policy decisions or legislation impacting on them, are made.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our experienced GHA team offers a range of services. We pride ourselves on the ‘personal touch’ as we steer our clients through the intricacies of the EU, and achieve for each of them an optimum solution.
