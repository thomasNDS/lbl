Activities in our organizations are held on a voluntary basis and they include different scenarios, from testing events to awareness meetings. All of them have the same purpose: to create knowledge about HIV and the discrimination against people living with HIV. &#xd;<br />One of the main objectives of our organization is to run the first Italian Checkpoint, called BLQ Checkpoint (www.blqcheckpoint.it): a facility, similar to others already functioning in several European cities, where people can get tested for HIV and other STIs with no charge, quickly, in a friendly environment, thus receiving the right kind of counselling about risk behaviours. In case of a positive HIV testing result, our counsellors also provide link to care.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Here’s a list of our main activities:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />• HIV and HCV testing: thanks to governmental public health/social programmes and a close collaboration with local authorities, in 2015 Plus onlus opened in Bologna the BLQ Checkpoint, the first community-based health centre in Italy, where we perform the above mentioned tests and offer counselling services based on the newest information about HIV, Hepatitis A, B and C and other STIs;&#xd;<br />• HIV publications (Sesso Gay Positivo, Capire il Chemsex: translated and adapted versions of the booklets HIV Positive Gay Sex and Understanding Chemsex);&#xd;<br />• HCV publications (Senza la C, Easy test HCV);&#xd;<br />• Training (courses for counsellors and operators, events on relevant themes like chemsex and TasP, focus groups and regular meetings for persons living with HIV/AIDS…).&#xd;<br />• Information campaigns on prevention strategies and/or against discrimination (such as: Sono undetectable, Pillole di buon sesso, Fallo come vuoi, Sano Positivo Libero, Positivo ma non Infettivo, HIV =).","acronym":"Plus","interests":"Public Health","euInitiatives":"In 2017 we applied for the Civil Society Forum on Hiv and Hepatitis.","lastUp":"2019-02-08T13:57:14.638+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
