GAHP was formed because international and national level actors/ agencies recognize that a collaborative, multi-stakeholder, multi-sectoral approach is necessary and critical to deal with the global pollution crisis and resulting health and economic impacts. GAHPâ€™s overall goal is to reduce death and illness caused by all forms of toxic pollution, including air, water, soil and chemical wastes especially in low-and middle-income countries. These efforts will contribute to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals related to pollution, particularly on Health (Targets 3.4 and 3.9). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />GAHP has been a project of Pure Earth since it was formed in 2012.  GAHP is currently incorporating as a foundation in Switzerland. Until it is formally incorporated (incorporation documents submitted in Switzerland on 12th December 2019) GAHP remains a project of Pure Earth and not a separate legal entity. Therefore, GAHP does not have any financial information to submit yet.","acronym":"GAHP","interests":"Climate Action, Environment, Public Health","euInitiatives":"EU Green New Deal, EU Zero Pollution&#xd;<br />Allocation of budget for DG Environment and DG DevCo / International Partnerships.","lastUp":"2019-12-12T15:22:07.019+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
