These eleven European-based associations represent several important “downstream” industry sectors ranging from cosmetics and detergents to aerosols, paints, inks, toners, pressroom chemicals, adhesives and sealants, construction chemicals, fragrances, lubricants and chemical distributors industries. &#xd;<br />DUCC aims to contribute to the successful implementation of the requirements of the REACH and CLP Regulations. More specifically, DUCC’s objectives are to:&#xd;<br />• offer a platform for associations/federations of downstream users of chemicals, which formulate and/or place on the market chemical mixtures intended for end-users, where they can exchange information and expertise, work on issues of common interestand build up common positions towards other stakeholders. &#xd;<br />• advise and help downstream users to implement the REACH and CLP Regulations, through common activities, guidance documents and practical tools. &#xd;<br />• initiate dialogue and co-ordinate activities with the European Commission and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to ensure, as far as possible, that downstream users’ concerns are appropriately addressed and to contribute to the implementation activities. &#xd;<br />• establish, where possible, common positions on EU chemicals legislation, jointly support these views and related amendments towards European Institutions, and provide input to Commission activities related to the legislation. &#xd;<br />• identify other areas of common interest where common views and activities would be of benefit for DUCC members’ companies.","acronym":"DUCC","interests":"Business and Industry, Consumers, Customs, Environment, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"REACH (including 2017 review); CLP; Fitness Check on chemicals legislation; Better Regulation; Non-Toxic Environment Strategy; Interface between Chemicals, Products and Waste.","lastUp":"2019-07-29T12:47:45.211+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
