It represents stakeholders of both the fishing sector (including catching, processing and marketing sectors, and trade unions), and other groups of interest (environmental and development for cooperation NGOs and civil society). It is currently composed by 52 members from 12 EU coastal Member States. It is recognised in the CFP Regulation (UE) No 1380/2013 as an organization aiming a European Interest.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Its mission is to provide advice to the European Commission and to the EU Member States on matters related to Fisheries Agreements with Third Countries, relations with Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) in which the EU is a contracting party, or with international organizations in whose waters the Community Fleet is operating, as well as other horizontal and cross-cutting issues such as international ocean governance, blue growth, or coherence between different EU policies related to fisheries (namely cooperation for development, labour, health and trade). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Its main goal is to promote the conservation of marine biodiversity and the sustainable use of fishing resources. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />More specifically, it is focused on three key areas of work:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1.
