The EDAA brings together European advertising industry associations with a stake in, and that make up the “value chain” for, Online Behavioural Advertising (“OBA”).

The EDAA’s activities will be specific and limited to areas directly concerning the practice of OBA within Europe. The term 'Europe' covers the member countries of the Council of Europe.
