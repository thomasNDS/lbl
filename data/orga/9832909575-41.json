Greenpeace aims to protect and conserve nature and to promote peace by investigating, exposing and confronting environmental abuse, challenging the political and economic powers that can effect change, driving economically responsible and socially just solutions that offer hope for current and future generations, and inspire people to take responsibility for the planet. Greenpeace speaks for c.3.2 million (March 2019 figure) supporters worldwide.&#xd;<br />Based in Brussels, Greenpeace European Unit monitors the work of the EU institutions, exposes deficient EU laws, challenges EU decision-makers to act responsibly in the public interest and confronts industry lobbies that undermine environmental protection in the pursuit of their private interests.&#xd;<br />Greenpeace is committed to transparency about EU interest representation and considers that this register fails basic transparency standards and does not provide EU lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register includes names of individuals and the issues that they try to influence, provides precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and has effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation (the guidelines developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU). Our registration therefore provides a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for their required activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of Greenpeace, carried out such activities. &#xd;<br />In the very limited space this form allows, we aim to give all the relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency.&#xd;<br />Our registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU. The guidelines can be found at https://www.alter-eu.org/sites/default/files/documents/2012_ALTER-EU_CSCG_guidelines_Transparency_Register.pdf","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Economy, finance and the euro, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Research and innovation, Trade, Transport","euInitiatives":"In 2018 Greenpeace European Unit followed the following issues:&#xd;<br />Transparency &amp; sustainability of the EU risk assessment in the food chain 2018/0088(COD)&#xd;<br />REFIT - Evaluation of the EU legislation on plant protection products and pesticides residues&#xd;<br />Union’s authorisation procedure for pesticides - 2018/2153(INI)&#xd;<br />Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) 2018/783, 2018/784, 2018/785 (ban on open field uses of 3 neonicotinoid insecticides)&#xd;<br />Commission Notice on the stepwise implementation of the EFSA Guidance Document on the Risk Assessment of Plant Protection Products on Bees (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp. and solitary bees)&#xd;<br />COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/2011 as regards the assessment of the impact of plant protection products on honey bees&#xd;<br />Commission's initiative on \"EU action to combat deforestation\"&#xd;<br />EU implementation of the Aarhus Convention in the area of access to justice in environmental matters&#xd;<br />A Clean Planet for all - A European strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy (Long-term climate strategy)&#xd;<br />Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) Governance Regulation Electricity Regulation and Electricity Directive, Platform for Coal and Carbon-Intensive Regions in Transition&#xd;<br />A Clean Planet for all - A European strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy (Long-term climate strategy)&#xd;<br />Common Agricultural Policy reform – Participation to the Public Consultation on the Future of Farming 2018/0216(COD)&#xd;<br />Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC&#xd;<br />COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS Closing the loop - An EU action plan for the Circular Economy COM/2015/0614 final&#xd;<br />A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy (SWD(2018)16final&#xd;<br />Single-Use Plastic proposal (draft SUP Directive) to be published in May 2019","lastUp":"2019-03-20T15:07:59.639+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
