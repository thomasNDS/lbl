Specifically, the EU-LIFE and Core for Life alliances allow the consortium members to share best practices and resources and to develop common strategies to promote Europe as a highly competitive and dynamic research environment. For further details, please visit: http://www.crg.eu/node/247.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe CRG is part of The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST) whose mission is to&#xd;\npromote cutting-edge research in science and technology within an environment of multidisciplinary scientific excellence. For further details, please visit: http://www.crg.eu/en/content/aboutus/&#xd;\ngeneral-information","goal":"The Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) is an international biomedical research institute of excellence, created in December 2000. It is a non-profit foundation funded by the Catalan Government through the Departments of Economy &amp; Knowledge and Health, the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, the \"la Caixa\" Banking Foundation, and includes the participation of Pompeu Fabra University. Its mission is to discover and advance knowledge for the benefit of society, public health and economic prosperity. Its goals are the following: 1. To be a world leading centre in biomedical science, by providing our scientists with a stimulating environment, cutting edge technologies and the freedom to conduct the most innovative research. 2. To communicate and establish a dialogue with society, by educating the public and being receptive to their needs. 3. To provide multi- and interdisciplinary training for the next generation of scientists as well as supporting science education. 4. To translate new scientific knowledge into benefits for health and value for society. The CRG believes that the medicine of the future depends on the ground-breaking science of today. This requires an interdisciplinary scientific team focused on understanding the complexity of life from the genome to the cell to a whole organism and its interaction with the environment, offering an integrated view of genetic diseases. The CRG is a unique centre in Spain, based in an innovative organisation research model. Group leaders at the CRG are recruited internationally and receive support from the centre to set up and run their groups. An external Scientific Advisory Board, made up of 13 world leaders in the different areas, evaluates them. The result of evaluations conditions the future of the CRG scientists, no matter whether they have open-ended or time-limited contracts. This ensures the mobility and the renewal of the workforce.","acronym":"CRG","interests":"Budget, External Relations, Institutional affairs, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"HR Excellence in Research: CRG received the European Commission’s “HR Excellence in Research” award&#xd;<br />in 2013.
