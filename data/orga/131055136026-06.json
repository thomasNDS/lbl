We call ourselves UASNL, Universities of Applied Sciences Netherlands. UASNL focuses their international profile around applied research and innovation. This is a problem-oriented approach to research, often in a triple or quadruple helix model with societal partners, SME’s and businesses.&#xd;<br />Ten topics&#xd;<br />Applied research contributes to a future-proof labour market and makes sure the UAS stay vital and innovative. The UASNL focus on one or more of the societal challenges that we deal with in The Netherlands, but also tackle global challenges. The UN SDG act as a strategic guideline from where specific research is being designed. Questions that are being tackled are for example: ‘Do cybercriminals have other habits than offline criminals?’, or ‘what does it take to make the flats build in the ’70 energy neutral?’. This societal focus is shown in the ten topics that the UASNL work with.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />These topics are:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />    Health: care and vitality&#xd;<br />    Education and talent development&#xd;<br />    Sustainable society: in the neighbourhood, city and region&#xd;<br />    Smart technology and materials&#xd;<br />    Build environment: sustainable and liveable&#xd;<br />    Sustainable transport and intelligent logistics&#xd;<br />    Sustainable agriculture, water and food provision&#xd;<br />    Energy and energy supply&#xd;<br />    Art and creative industry&#xd;<br />    Responsible and innovative entrepreneurship&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Regional challenges&#xd;<br />Some UAS focus on one of these topics, but often multiple topics are tackled in different research groups within one UAS. In most cases regional challenges are leading in the specific challenges that the UAS focuses on. All UASNL have research groups build around a societal challenge, often with a Center of Expertise (CoE). A CoE is a partnerships which involves one or more UAS, companies, governments and other public organisations. Here they experiment, innovate and invest in societal challenges such as the energy transition, healthy ageing or futureproof sustainable water supplies.","acronym":"UASNL","interests":"Budget, Climate Action, Communication, Culture, Energy, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"The development towards Horizon Europe, DG RTD, DG EAC, DG ENVE, CULT committee, ITRE committee","lastUp":"2019-09-26T11:32:36.257+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
