It works for end-user clients but also as technology supplier for other engineering companies. It has more than 30 partners (multinational and large enterprises, SMEs and research institutions) collaborating in new developments and industrial implementations.&#xd;<br />CEINNMAT bases its strategy on corporate alliances to enhance its rapid implementation into the market, and to provide the maximum impact to the stakeholders. It has been involved in trade missions and market research for the technology introduction in Latin American and African markets.&#xd;<br />CEINNMAT plans to become the leader of supplying microwave for raw materials industry within Europe. The company has published and developed some National and European R&amp;D projects related to advanced raw material treatment technologies. This experience has allowed CEINNMAT to create a new electromagnetic metallurgy (EM) treatment processes as well heating technology of continuous flow based on microwave. EM technology will increase process efficiency and productivity, reduce environmental impact and the human health risk, as well as increasing the economic benefits for EU countries, becoming a valuable opportunity for the raw materials market suitable for a wide range of materials according with their complex permittivity and permeability. EM technology has technical features of high added value as to be implemented in places with limited infrastructure, such as no water dependent, modularity in design, flexibility, versatility and portability with electrical energy only that provide even more potentiality for fast instruction into the market (see picture of one of the pilot facilities built on the right below).&#xd;<br />High and low temperature microwave equipment has been developed during last years in cooperation with collaborators considering the properties and conditions of the material treated.","acronym":"CEINNMAT","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"- EIP Raw Materials Spanish Experts (www.cdti.es).&#xd;<br />- A Joint European and African Research and Innovation Agenda on Waste Management (http://jointeuauwasteworkshop.teamwork.fr/en/agenda&#xd;<br />).&#xd;<br />- ECTP, European Construction Technology Platform (www.ectp.org)&#xd;<br />- MANUFUTURE-E, Spanish Technological platform of research in the area of the Manufacture (www.manufuture.es)&#xd;<br />- Materplat, Technological Spanish platform of Advanced Materials and Nanomaterials (www.materplat.org)&#xd;<br />- PT4FS, Technological Spanish platform of Food for Life (www.foodforlife-spain.es)&#xd;<br />- Member of Spanish delegation to the NMP program of FP7 in 2010,  - Member of scientific societies of Geology (EGU, SGE, AEQUA).&#xd;<br />- Member of microwave technology (AMPERE)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Technology provider in Raw Material Commitments:&#xd;<br />•\tBRAVO (RMC-H2020-EU. 2014).
