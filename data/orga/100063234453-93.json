At the European level, these organizations have to give proof of the cogency of this specificity, and to defend this differentiated approach to social security of farming and rural populations. &#xd;<br />The organizations are and will stay invested together, in order to maintain and develop the European network between all of them. With this network the agricultural social security schemes will affirm the bonds which link them together at the EU level.&#xd;<br />The network is thought firstly as a forum facilitating better mutual understanding among all of its members and secondly as a group that represents European separate social security systems, dealing with farming and rural cases of a specific social nature and recognized as such by the European Union.&#xd;<br />The network is open to additional members or observers.&#xd;<br />The members of the network are committed to put their knowledge and their activities in common. Thanks to their implication, their experience and their will to take part in the construction of a social Europe that would take the specificities and the needs of the farming and rural populations into account, the network will go on to fulfill the following missions:&#xd;<br />Defense and strengthening of the values and principles of agricultural social security based on solidarity and territorial cohesion;&#xd;<br />Defense and reinforcement of the values and principles of welfare policy and social benefits;&#xd;<br />Representation of the interests of agricultural social security before the European Union authorities, without however, acting in place of members and their individual activities and collaborations;&#xd;<br />Recognition by the European Union authorities of the network as a forum for consultation;&#xd;<br />Creation of a forum for exchanging information and sharing good practices among its members;&#xd;<br />Development of synergies and cooperation initiatives among members to meet clearly-defined shared requirements;&#xd;<br />Exchange of publications and support at a national level;&#xd;<br />In addition, and parallel to this network, the signatories of this treaty wish that they could launch projects within the framework of European Union calls for projects.","acronym":"ENASP","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Food Safety, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Regional Policy","euInitiatives":"Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the Common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council&#xd;<br />COM/2018/392 final - 2018/0216 (COD)&#xd;<br />Topics around health and safety in agriculure,, migrant workers in agriculture, pensions","lastUp":"2019-04-03T11:27:45.904+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
