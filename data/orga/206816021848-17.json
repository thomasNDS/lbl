An NGO regulated by the UK charity commission, the Foundation does not represent sectorial or industrial interests, and interacts with EU institutions as provider of economic analysis, case studies and insights on the specific topic of circular economy - for which the Foundation is the global leading reference point. As part of the implementation strategy of the EU Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plan, adopted on Dec. 2, 2015, the Foundation has meetings with various Directorate Generals and regularly intervenes in official events put together by the Commission, the Parliament and the European Economic and Social Council in order to bring its perspective and share knowledge in a policy-relevant yet not prescriptive way.","lastUp":"2019-03-26T18:01:00.918+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
