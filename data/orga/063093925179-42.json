Our aim is to contribute to cleaner oceans by reducing and reusing floating litter. Starting as a pilot project in Europe to encourage fishermen and the plastics industry to collaborate, we now engage in marine litter clean-ups around the world. Together with companies we then turn collected waste into innovative, sustainable products.","acronym":"WFO","interests":"Climate Action, Environment, Maritime affairs and fisheries","euInitiatives":"Circular economy, Waste legislation, Water legislation&#xd;<br />Landill legislation, EMFF, MSFD&#xd;<br />Port Reception Facilities, EU regional seas conventions","lastUp":"2019-11-13T15:47:35.429+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
