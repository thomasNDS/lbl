In fulfillment of this mandate it is responding to the message of the Bible which insists on the dignity of every human being and to the understanding of unity as devoid of any distinction between strangers and natives.” (CCME mission statement)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Founded in 1964, the Churches’ Commission for Migrants in Europe (CCME) is an organisation of churches and ecumenical councils from currently eighteen European countries.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since the General Assembly of CCME in October 1999 in Järvenpää/Finland the mandate of CCME has been expanded to cover the whole area of migration and integration, refugees and asylum, and racism and xenophobia. CCME s work on uprooted people is part of the cooperation with the Conference of European Churches and the World Council of Churches.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CCME provides a space for churches and Christian agencies to share their experiences in the ministry among migrants, refugees, and minority ethnic persons. CCME is part of a wider ecumenical network of the World Council of Churches and the Conference of European Churches. It participates in a network of NGOs throughout Europe and has launched the Migration News Sheet and the Migration Policy Group.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CCME maintains regular contacts with the European Commission, the European Parliament and Council of the European Union. CCME also holds official observer status with the Council of Europe (Strasbourg/F) and observes the Migration Committee of the Council of Ministers. This enables CCME to monitor European policy-making in the migration, integration and asylum spheres and to present the concerns of the churches to the relevant institutions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CCME promotes the adoption and implementation of international standards such as the European Social Charter, the European Convention on the Protection of the Legal Status of Migrant Workers, and the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. CCME has also made specific proposals for the adoption of a European immigration policy and for equal treatment of European citizens and third-country nationals.","acronym":"CCME","interests":"Borders and Security, Culture, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Youth","euInitiatives":"Asylum and migration policy, in particular safe passages to Europe, anti discrimination, search and rescue","lastUp":"2019-07-23T16:02:06.253+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
