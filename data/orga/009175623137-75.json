We represent education employers in all levels of education, from pre-school to higher education institutions. This includes different national organisations, such as education councils and ministries of education, associations of colleges and universities and local and regional authority employersâ€™ organisations. In total we have 32 members representing 16 European countries. Our mission is to improve the quality of teaching and school management through European cooperation and dialogue. EFEE acts on behalf of its members in its role as officially recognised European social partner in education and as an official dialogue partner to EU institutions. Our aims are to raise awareness on and increase commitment to the European policy agenda, influence European policy, dialogue with unions, network and be the voice of our members at EU level. EFEE strives to represent the whole of the diverse education sector and is recognised by the European Commission as an official European social partner in the policy consultation process. EFEE also facilitates access to a range of networks, international projects and funding. This connection stimulates the valuable exchange of knowledge and best practices among member organisations.","acronym":"EFEE","interests":"Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"In particular EFEE follows EU initiatives in the field of Education and Training, Research, Social Affairs, Employment and Inclusion.
