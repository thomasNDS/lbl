Road freight transport is the source of 5-7 % of global CO2 emissions and the industry is not showing any signs of changing. Each year emissions increase due to increased transport and lack of cost competitive sustainable alternatives.  &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />By rethinking road freight from scratch, Einride has developed a solution that has the potential to revolutionize transport by being both cost competitive and sustainable.  Einride’s solution is called an AET (Autonomous Electric Transport) system and is based on autonomous, all-electric vehicles, coordinated by what is best likened to an intelligent “operative system” for road freight. Einrides “AET” system includes an order management platform, a fleet management platform, self-driving and remote-control technology, and vehicles.","acronym":"","interests":"Climate Action, Communication, Research and innovation, Transport","euInitiatives":"Initiatives related to transportation, energy and climate.
