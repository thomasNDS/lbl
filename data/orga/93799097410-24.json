SES owns and operates a global fleet of 68 satellites (March 2018) which cover an area that is home to 99% of the world’s population. The company leases transmission capacity on these satellites to public service and commercial TV broadcasters, to enable the distribution of programme content to viewers, either direct-to-home, or via cable networks.

The SES satellite fleet is the world’s leading platform for the broadcasting of audio-visual media.
