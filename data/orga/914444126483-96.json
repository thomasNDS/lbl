With partners and contributors, we mapped out possible steps the animal health industry can take on the digital transformation journey to reduce the stress of compliance for farmers, while contributing to wider societal challenges, such as antimicrobial resistance and animal disease surveillance.&#xd;<br />VirtualVet – we reduce risks.","acronym":"VV","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Environment, Food Safety, Information Society, Public Health","euInitiatives":"EU Animal Health Law, EU Digital Agenda, CAP reform","lastUp":"2018-03-25T11:51:48.268+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
