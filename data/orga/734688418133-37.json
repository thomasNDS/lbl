They wished to defend, protect and enhance the value of that important technical and cultural patrimony which is the art of olive oil tasting.&#xd;\nThe Organization pays close attention to issues such as product quality, correct storage and use and consumer education. ONAOO strives to maintain a totally open outlook on all areas of production worldwide, both around and beyond the Mediterranean, and to appreciate the organoleptic characteristics of great oils worldwide. We firmly believe that quality, like culture, has no borders.","memberOrga":"","goal":"to make consumers aware of possible food fraud with olive oil and other products due to bad production, legislation, distribution etcetera","acronym":"","interests":"Food Safety, Trade","euInitiatives":"food fraud and all other topics related to this subject.
