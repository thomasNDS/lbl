Promotion of AVMs&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EAA participates in and sponsors key industry events on structured finance conferences to increase visibility of the range of AVM products and suppliers across Europe, and to demonstrate the benefits of AVMs to stakeholders, ranging from mortgage lenders to property and capital markets investors.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. Representation of the AVM industry’s interests&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EAA is in dialogue with European and national institutions and regulators to exchange information on newest technical standards in order to emphasise the differentials between different Statistical Valuation Techniques in the context of Portfolio Valuations of residential collateral, and to demonstrate the superior accuracy of comparables-based AVMs in terms of transparency and reliability of the valuation results.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />3. Establishment of consistently high Quality Standards for AVMs through the EAA AVM Label&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EAA’s goal is to establish consistently high quality standards for AVMs across European jurisdictions. The AVMs within the EAA fulfil the highest technical requirements within the industry, set and fully adhered to by all EAA members. Compliance with these requirements is certified through a rigorous and transparent assessment procedure by the EAA AVM label. Continued adherence to these requirements is monitored on a regular basis, demonstrably yielding results superior to those of traditional solutions, e.g. House Price Indices and all other statistical tools.","acronym":"EAA","interests":"Banking and financial services","euInitiatives":"European Covered Bond Framework&#xd;<br />Secondary Market for NPLs&#xd;<br />Implementation of CRR II and CRD V&#xd;<br />Capitals Market Union&#xd;<br />Implementation of the Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD)&#xd;<br />Basel III Implementation&#xd;<br />Securitisation","lastUp":"2019-03-26T16:26:18.302+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
