This includes increases in production efficiency as well as re-using production waste as input material were possible.&#xd;<br />The DPP network is developing multiple strategies that each focus on optimising phosphorus use efficiency, recycling rates and substitution potential to work towards the combined goal of sustainable phosphorus use throughout Germany.","acronym":"DPP","interests":"Agriculture, Climate Action, Consumers, Environment, Food Safety, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"- circular economy&#xd;<br />- fertilizer regulation, STRUBIAS working group,&#xd;<br />- water and wastewater policy&#xd;<br />- nitrate directive&#xd;<br />- Mission nutrients","lastUp":"2018-10-12T09:38:57.915+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
