FOGGS is a non-profit, public benefit foundation under Belgian law and is governed by its statutes.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The FOGGS founders were inspired by the work of the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability (2010-2012), which, among other things, was instrumental in introducing the concept of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The initial aspiration was for FOGGS to continue the Panel’s work, including in the area of the economy, which had proven particularly sensitive for the Panel to tackle.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since December 2017, FOGGS has been relaunched with new ambition and primary focus on putting together a positive and sustainable “Grand Narrative” for the era of globalisation that we are living in.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Grand Narrative is a story that brings together humankind and reconciles it with the planet we live on. It is a means to re-tool personal, business and political choices and apply in practice an innovative and sustainable economy geared towards human well-being, a society that respects diversity, a natural environment that is at balance and systems of governance that are transparent, inclusive and work for all.","acronym":"FOGGS","interests":"Banking and financial services, Climate Action, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"EU External Action, EU at the United Nations, EU Development Cooperation, EU and SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) implementation, EU and the Paris Agreement / EU Climate and Energy Targets, Regulation of online platforms","lastUp":"2019-02-19T23:38:46.252+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
