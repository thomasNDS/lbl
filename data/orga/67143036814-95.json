Furthermore around 80% of the sector’s exports come from ASSICA Member Companies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since its foundation, in 1946, ASSICA has always showed a co-operative attitude and professional reliability which are witnessed by the active role we play in several organisations both at national and European level such as: CONFINDUSTRIA (Federation of Italian Industries), FEDERALIMENTARE (Italian Food and Drink Federation), CLITRAVI (Liaison Centre for the Meat Processing Industry in the EU)and FOODDRINKEUROPE.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Moreover, the association has been publishing a monthly House Organ, titled “L’INDUSTRIA DELLE CARNI E DEI SALUMI” (THE MEAT INDUSTRY), for over than fifty years, and is directly involved in the editorial line, in the selection of the contents and in the various phases of  making and distribution.","acronym":"ASSICA","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Economic and Financial Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Internal Market, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"At present, at EU level, the priorities of the association focus mainly on food safety - both finished products and raw materials – and on commercial policies, able to guarantee the effective implementation of the internal market principles on one side, and new and increasing opportunities to penetrate third countries markets on the other. The two issues mentioned above, along with other issues such as quality policies, represent both sides of the same project and of the same entrepreneurial vision, aimed at satisfying the consumer’s needs and expectations of protection.","lastUp":"2017-02-23T09:39:30.890+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
