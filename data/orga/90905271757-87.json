ETRC also seeks to ensure that future legislation does not hinder or damage the industry but promotes growth and innovation ultimately for the benefit for all travellers within the EU.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ETRC has a keen interest in the review of the Air Passenger Rights Regulation which has been held up in Council due to an unrelated political dispute and, although welcoming the Commission’s publication of Indicative Guidelines on current air passenger rights, looks forward to the eventual adoption of the revised regulation which recognizes that airlines should not be allowed to impose a “one-bag rule” on passenger’s hand luggage.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Another issue that has been the subject of intense activity with the European Institutions over the years has been associated with the problems encountered by the carriage of duty free liquids, etc. (LAGs) as a consequence of the upgraded aviation security rules adopted following the terrorist threat to trans-Atlantic aircraft in August 2006. ETRC continues to participate in the process of developing upgraded security systems that will simplify and facilitate passengers’ movement through airport security and ease the restrictions on the carriage of LAGs by travellers. ETRC also contributes to the discussions on enhancing maritime security.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ETRC has also been representing its members interests with regards to the growing demand for the provision of information to consumers that impacts several product categories sold in duty-free and travel retail; food, alcohol, and cosmetics. ETRC is pro-actively advocating for the recognition of the use of digital labelling.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ETRC, its member associations and companies are following closely the implementation of the Tobacco Products Directive, specifically related to implications for the duty free channel as the Member States adopt the new rules in national legislation, particularly on Track &amp; Trace requirements.","lastUp":"2018-07-12T11:20:10.318+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
