ECMA was founded in the early â€˜90s as the representative body of the European manufacturers of cigars. Today ECMA represents the major cigar manufacturers in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain (including the Canary Islands) and the United Kingdom. Together the ECMA members account for over 90% of the cigars produced in and exported from the European Union. With a total number of approximately 7.4 billion cigars being consumed within the European Union each year, cigar consumption represents barely 1% of the total consumption of tobacco products (cigarettes, smoking tobacco and cigars) in the European Union. This makes the cigar industry the smallest member of the tobacco family.","memberOrga":"","goal":"Royal Agio Cigars is a family business founded in 1904.
