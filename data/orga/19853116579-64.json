Around 20% of the electricity generated in the EU is coal-based.  Members of EURACOAL undertake coal-related research that supports EURACOAL's three-step clean coal strategy. EURACOAL's objective is to highlight the important role that coal plays in securing energy supply within the EU and to contribute to an appropriate and reliable legal framework for coal extraction and use in Europe. EURACOAL actively promotes the importance of coal in a balanced energy mix, the added value provided by the coal industry at regional and national levels, and the need for safe working practices and environmental protection. EURACOAL recognises the need for a transition to clean and affordable energy.  It is active in the European Commission’s initiative known as the Coal Regions in Transition Platform, especially in regards to clean coal technologies.  For example, a coal R&amp;D strategy is being developed by EURACOAL within the CoalTech2051 project supported by the EU Research Fund for Coal and Steel.","acronym":"EURACOAL","interests":"Climate Action, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Regional Policy, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"EU Emissions Trading System; Clean Planet for All; &#xd;<br />Water Framework Directive Implementation; Waste Directive and Landfill Directive Revision; Guidance “Managing Natura 2000 sites -The provisions of Article 6 of the ‘Habitats’ Directive 92/43/EEC”; Legislation to follow the New Green Deal in regard to energy sector; Just Transition Fund regulation; BAT Conclusions Under IED: Large Combustion Plants","lastUp":"2019-12-06T15:21:17.040+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
