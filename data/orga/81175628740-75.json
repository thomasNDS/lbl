These are shipowners in the tanker and bulk transport sector, short sea sector and offshore service sector. The NSA aims to represent its members' interests in the development of policies and regulations that affect the industry, be it industrial, environmental, social, technological or other issues.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The NSA's history is a century-long journey, but this history began long before the foundation of the NSA in 1909. Norway has always been a maritime nation; shipping is an important part of our identity - and is a key aspect of Norwegian industry, settlement and employment. The maritime industries account for more than seven percent of value creation in Norway and now represent a vital, rounded and competitive industrial cluster.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The shipowners and offshore companies are the core of this industrial cluster. As an employers’ and professional organisation for its member companies, the NSA’s objective is to realise the added value inherent in a communality of focus, to the benefit of the industry and the individual member. It is our aim to translate our members’ value-creation, ability to innovate, power and influence – and Norway’s overall maritime status and reputation – into effective action in the industry’s interests, both nationally and internationally.","acronym":"NSA","interests":"Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Consumers, Customs, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"1.
