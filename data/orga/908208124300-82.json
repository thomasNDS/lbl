The Board of Directors as well as the personnel have been engaged in animal protection for many years, only educated and trained personnel works at the organization. In order to gain credibility, no project is carried out without previous validation and the review of the existing scientific and empirical evidence and we do not publish information without evidence. We look for sustainable, long- term solutions to improve the living conditions for farm animals. &#xd;<br />Our work is based on the following ethical principles: 1) Animals are sentient beings; 2) The rights and dignity of the animals are inviolable 3) There is no distinction between animal species 4) There is no moral justification for suffering. The goal of animal welfare is to raise the status of animals, not reduce the status of human vision.","acronym":"AWF","interests":"Agriculture, Consumers, Food Safety, Public Health, Trade, Transport","euInitiatives":"Our main projects are: Farm animal transport within Europe and to third countries, Horsemeat imports, Blood farms and Police training to support the enforcement of Regulation 1/2005 regarding the welfare of animals during transport.","lastUp":"2018-10-10T15:08:22.007+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
