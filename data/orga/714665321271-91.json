The institute is committed to the research and development in physical and natural sciences, mainly Nuclear Physics and Nuclear Engineering, and in related areas including Astrophysics and Particle Physics, Field Theory, Mathematical and Computational Physics, Atomic Physics and Physics of Condensed Matter, Life and Environmental Physics. In all these fields, IFIN-HH conducts theoretical and experimental research while keeping a focus on some secondary research fields such as technology development and technology transfer. &#xd;<br />While focusing its mission on advanced investigations in Atomic and Sub-atomic Physics, IFIN-HH is also committed to widening the positive impact of the Nuclear on industry, other business areas, as well as on the society at large, via a diversified offer of unique professional services.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />IFIN-HH plays an important role within the Romanian research infrastructure, being the only national laboratory in nuclear physics with activity in the following areas: radiation metrology, treatment and storage of radioactive waste, monitoring environmental radioactivity, radiological risk assessment, elaboration of national strategies for nuclear safety and security, etc.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The institute’s research activities are undertaken within  national, european, and international cooperation with some of the most prestigious R&amp;D organizations in the world and also with the academic community (e.g. Nuclear Physics Institute (Czech Rep.), ATOMKI (Hungary), RIKEN (Japan), Texas A&amp;M University (USA), IN2P3 (France), INFN (Italy), CEA (France), Research Center for Nuclear Physics RNCP, University of Osaka, (Japan), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe (Germania), Pierre Auger Collaboration (a large consortium of R&amp;D institutions from 4 continents, based in Argentina), JRP – Consortium Agreement ENV54 MetroDecom.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Institute was involved in the following international research programs: UE HORIZON 2020, FP7, EURATOM; others: EMRP, EURAMET, FEDR Romania – Bulgary.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Further increasing its national and international visibility and attracting significant scientific collaborations, IFIN-HH proved itself by taking on the implementation of the Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics project (ELI-NP) www.eli-np.ro/.&#xd;<br />ELI-NP will be the only European and International Centre for high-level research on ultra-high intensity laser, laser-matter interaction and secondary sources with unparalleled possibilities. Its pulse peak power and briefness will go beyond the current state-of-the-art by several orders of magnitude. &#xd;<br />The project was enlisted on the ESFRI Road map (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructure – a strategic intrument to develop the scientific integration of Europe and to strengthen its international outreach), confirming its quality and value for the global scientific community.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Through its ever succesful endeavours, IFIN-HH continues to consolidated its status of  the most representative institute of Romania at European and international level in the field of fundamental and applied nuclear physics, and to ensure a standard of activities comparable to the major research institutes in the world.&#xd;<br />The Institute’s performances in exciting areas of Physics will always constitute a genuine source of wisdom for our community and an inspiring model of excellent inquiry for our youths while preserving its status of Romania’s main interface with the international scientific community.","acronym":"IFIN-HH","interests":"Budget, Communication, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Energy, Foreign affairs and security policy, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"IFIN-HH is following the EU policy-making process, legislative initiatives and funding programmes related to knowledge, research &amp; innovation, development of research infrastructures and technology transfer.&#xd;<br />It is particularly interested in the European legal frameworks such as ERIC (the European Research Infrastructure Consortium) and in the European funding programme Horizon 2020 –and is closely following on the ESFRI’s activity (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures).","lastUp":"2019-03-25T07:48:56.844+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
