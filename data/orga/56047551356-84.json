Our main purpose is to foster the development and dissemination of Waste-to-Energy, a technology that is complementary to recycling and helps minimising landfilling. We seek to raise awareness of the positive implications of the technology both for the environment and the production of energy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Waste-to-Energy is an integral part of sustainable waste management, as reflected by its role in the Waste Hierarchy of the EU’s Waste Framework Directive.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ESWET believes that Waste-to-Energy (also called Energy-from-Waste) has an important role to play both on the energy recovery and on the environmental aspects of managing waste that is not suitable for recycling.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Making a valuable contribution to the reduction of Greenhouse Gas emissions through better waste management and cleaner energy, Waste-to-Energy is a solution to multiple challenges.","acronym":"ESWET","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"IED and BREFs, Circular Economy, Energy &amp; Climate Package, etc","lastUp":"2020-01-06T17:26:20.109+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
