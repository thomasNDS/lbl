It brings together more than 70 members - European railway undertakings, their national associations as well as infrastructure companies. The membership is made up of long-established bodies, new entrants and both private and public enterprises. CER members represent about 73% of the rail network length, 80% of the rail freight business and about 96% of rail passenger operations in EU, EFTA and EU accession countries.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CER is based in Brussels and represents its members’ interests vis-à-vis the European Parliament, Commission and Council of Ministers as well as other policy makers and transport actors. CER’s main focus is promoting the strengthening of rail as essential to the creation of a sustainable transport system which is efficient, effective and environmentally sound. Within this framework, a key priority is the achievement of a more balanced modal split in the transport system, eliminating high external costs to society and improving economic efficiency. In parallel to the railways’ own initiatives for improving the quality of rail services, CER sees mobilising adequate investments in rail infrastructure as a prerequisite for achieving a sustainable modal split. CER’s portfolio covers all policy areas with a potential impact on railway transport offering advice and recommendations to European policy makers. Its interests span the whole spectrum of European transport policy: infrastructure planning, passenger and freight services, public service, the environment, research and development and social dialogue. In close cooperation with its members, CER monitors and evaluates the implementation of policies. In permanent dialogue with policy makers it proposes calibration of legislation to address remaining problems. Two railway companies from outside the immediate European area (Georgia and Japan) have become CER partners, opening up cross-fertilisation opportunities on best practices and lessons learned with other regions.","acronym":"CER","interests":"Budget, Climate Action, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Customs, Economic and Financial Affairs, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Enterprise, Environment, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Fourth Railway Package, Transport White Paper mid-term review, Juncker Plan/EFSI.","lastUp":"2018-04-18T17:41:44.269+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1000000-1249999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
