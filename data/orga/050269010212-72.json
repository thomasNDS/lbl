Voted number one climate research provider by investors and working with institutional investors with assets of US$96 trillion, we leverage investor and buyer power to motivate companies to disclose and manage their environmental impacts. Globally, over 7000 companies with some 50% of global market capitalization disclosed environmental data through CDP in 2018, with over 1800 in Europe. This is in addition to the over 750 cities, states and regions globally who disclosed – including more than 200 in Europe – making CDP’s platform one of the richest sources of information globally on how companies and governments are driving environmental change. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We want to see a thriving economy that works for people and planet in the long term. The process of disclosing information to CDP, and the insights the data brings, focuses investors, companies and cities on taking urgent action to build a truly sustainable economy by measuring and understanding their environmental impact. Since pioneering the global environmental disclosure system, CDP has driven corporates and cities around the world to understand and act on the business case for reducing their impact. Central to CDP’s mission is communicating the progress made in addressing environmental issues and highlighting where risks may be unmanaged. To this end, we score disclosers on the information they provide, assessing not only tangible impacts such as emission reduction activities, but also how climate change, water risk and deforestation issues are integrated into governance, strategy and risk assessment processes. We produce annual Climate Change, Water and Forests A Lists, used to show the market how leading companies are performing. To increase transparency and drive sustainable investments, CDP provides a critical source of global data that delivers evidence and insights to a wide audience, including investors, companies, policymakers and their advisors, public sector organizations, government bodies, academics and the general public. Also tracking companies’ performance against the goals of the Paris Agreement, CDP data enables our network to link environmental integrity, fiduciary duty and public interest to make better-informed decisions on climate action.","acronym":"CDP Europe","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Banking and financial services, Climate Action, Economy, finance and the euro, Energy, Environment","euInitiatives":"Regulation on disclosures relating to sustainable investments and sustainability risks and amending Directive (EU) 2016/2341; Regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment; Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 on low carbon benchmarks and positive carbon impact benchmarks; Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID II) – Directive 2014/65/EU; Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFIR) – Regulation (EU) No 600/2014; Insurance Distribution Directive 2016/97; Capital Requirements Directive 2013/36/EU; Capital requirements regulation 575/2013; Directive 2014/95/EU on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups; Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC); Timber Regulation (995/2010); Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement; EU 2050 Long-term Strategy; EU initiative on stepping up EU Action against Deforestation and Forest Degradation.","lastUp":"2019-05-27T10:48:23.796+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
