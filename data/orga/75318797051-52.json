We support evidence-based policies that are effective in reducing drug-related harm. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />IDPC produces briefing papers, disseminates the reports of its member organisations about particular drug-related matters, and offers expert advice to policy makers and officials around the world.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />IDPC members have a wide range of experience and expertise in the analysis of drug problems and policies, and have contributed to policy debates at national and international level.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We have two main objectives:&#xd;<br />- We provide channels for grassroots organisations to better engage with policy making processes: we facilitate communication and cooperation between civil society stakeholders, and we produce and disseminate information and materials on more effective and humane drug policies, that national and local NGOs can use in their own work. We also organise capacity building trainings to support the drug policy advocacy work of NGOs. In order to facilitate civil society engagement, we organise our work regionally.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- We draw on the knowledge within our network to offer expert advice to policy makers on how best to review their drug policies at the national and international level. The IDPC network includes many individuals who have experience of creating or reviewing government drug policies and strategies, and these individuals are available to engage in high-level discussions with policy makers.","acronym":"IDPC","interests":"Borders and Security, Communication, External Relations, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"IDPC is part of the Civil Society Forum on Drugs (CSF).
