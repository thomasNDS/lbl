In recent years the interest representational activities of the ECG have largely focused on aspects of the Statutory Audit Directive (Directive 2006/46/EC). The ECG's principal concern was to ensure that the adopted Directive would help enhance the quality of audits and financial reporting for the benefit of the capital markets both within the EU and around the world. Following the&#xd;<br />adoption of an Amended Statutory Audit Directive in April 2014 together with a separate Regulation on the statutory audits of Public Interest Entities, the ECG will monitor the effective implementation to assess whether it is working in the public interest and will pursue a range of other initiatives that support the reputation of the 6 member networks of ECG  and the public interest.","lastUp":"2017-02-14T11:48:28.504+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"500000-599999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
