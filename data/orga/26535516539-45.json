We have also secured landmark agreements to outlaw the barren battery cage for egg-laying hens, narrow veal crates and sow stalls across Europe&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Compassion in World Farming’s Food Business Team is working with some of the world’s biggest food companies - retailers, producers and manufacturers. The companies we work with are a key part of the drive towards a more ethical and sustainable food supply. Our Good Farm Animal Welfare awards are already benefitting millions of animals each year.","acronym":"CIWF","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Consumers, Environment, Food Safety, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Research and innovation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Antimicrobial resistance&#xd;<br />EU sustainable food and farming policy&#xd;<br />Sustainable Development Goals&#xd;<br />COP23&#xd;<br />Common Agricultural Policy&#xd;<br />Enforcement of acquis on animal welfare&#xd;<br />Bilateral and multilateral trade agreements&#xd;<br />All current legislative proposals and existing laws on farm animal welfare&#xd;<br />Reduction in production and consumption of animal products&#xd;<br />Public procurement&#xd;<br />Labelling in regards to animal welfare and method of production&#xd;<br />Ending the use of cages in animal farming","lastUp":"2019-02-09T09:46:33.531+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
