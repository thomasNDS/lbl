SOS Children's Villages is a non-governmental and non-denominational child-focused organisation that provides direct services in the areas of care, education and health for children at risk of losing parental care, and those who have lost parental care. The organisation also builds the capacity of the children's caregivers, their families and communities to provide adequate care.&#xd;<br />SOS Children's Villages advocates for the rights of children without parental care and those at risk of losing parental care. Founded in 1949, its operations are guided by the spirit of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children.","acronym":"SOS KDI","interests":"Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, European Neighbourhood Policy, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Regional Policy, Youth","euInitiatives":"SOS Children’s Villages advocates for the rights of children without parental care or at risk of losing parental care. We are making sure that their voices are heard and represented at EU level. We have a focus on children’s rights, tackling child poverty and social exclusion, de-institutionalisation and alternative care, education and youth employment, youth participation.&#xd;<br />In 2018, we started a new DG Justice co-funded project “Leaving Care”. Building upon the materials and experience developed through previous projects, trainings on leaving care will be held in 6 partner countries for care professionals about how to integrate a child rights-based approach into their work and best prepare children and young people for leaving care. From 2017 to 2018, we implemented the DG Justice co-funded project \"Prepare for Leaving Care\" in cooperation with CELCIS and partners in 5 EU countries. In this project we built capacity of care professionals to better support young people during the transition phase from care to independent life. In 2015-2016, we implemented the DG Justice co-funded project “Training Professionals Working with Children in Care” in partnership with the EC, the Council of Europe, Eurochild and partners in 8 EU countries. The project contributed to improving the living conditions and life prospects of children and young people living in alternative care, by providing care professionals with continued training in how to apply a child rights-based approach to their work. In 2016, we published the study “Leaving Care and Employment in Five European Countries: An Undocumented Problem?” that explores the challenging employment situation for young people leaving care in 5 European countries. During the same year, we also became an international partner for the European Campaign \"Opening Doors for Europe's Children\". In accordance with the unified approach within our federation, the above-mentioned thematic priorities are equally valid for our development sector work. In this area, one of the main highlights is that we won a tender in 2016 from DG DEVCO to carry out a study that compares alternative care systems globally. In 2017 in partnership with the EC and CELCIS, we published our study \"Towards the Right Care for Children: Orientations for reforming alternative care systems in Africa, Asia, Latin America\".&#xd;<br />With services in 135 countries and territories, we inform our advocacy thought our programme expertise in Europe and abroad. As an example of our work in the past is that we achieved in alliance with other stakeholders, an explicit priority reference to “de-institutionalisation” (transition from institutional to community-based care) in the European Structural and Investment Fund envelopes for EU member states. Ensuring that the post-2020 Multi-Annual Financial Framework invests in children without or at risk of losing parental care is a main priority of our EU advocacy work going forward.&#xd;<br />With our coordination role of 135 member associations, the SOS members at national level are supported to influence and use the EU policy and funding framework in their work. Among other activities to bring the EU closer to our federation, we use materials such as a regular “EU Update”, as well as more detailed briefings and fact sheets to share relevant EU developments, involve member associations in EU consultations and processes and provide support to arrange meetings with EU level stakeholders (EU delegations and in Brussels). We also support SOS programme and funding strategy development from an EU perspective, capacity development and we provide EU funding application writing support.&#xd;<br />SOS Children’s Villages is member and leader of formal networks and informal alliances such as Eurochild, the Opening Door, the Child Rights Action Group, CONCORD, VOICE and the EU Alliance for Investing in Children. It has also developed strong partnership with the Council of Europe in the area of children’s rights and youth participation.","lastUp":"2019-10-28T11:59:29.787+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
