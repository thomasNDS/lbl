What should they do to capitalize on new opportunities, overcome challenges, and avoid potential pitfalls? The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) exists to provide answers and point the way forward. Founded in 2006, ITIF is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute—a think tank—whose mission is to formulate, evaluate, and promote policy solutions that accelerate innovation and boost productivity to spur growth, opportunity, and progress. Ranked by the University of Pennsylvania as the world’s leading science and technology think tank, ITIF’s goal is to provide policymakers around the world with high-quality information, analysis, and recommendations they can trust. To that end, ITIF adheres to a high standard of research integrity with an internal code of ethics grounded in analytical rigor, policy pragmatism, and independence from external direction or bias.","acronym":"ITIF","interests":"Communication, Competition, Digital economy and society, Energy, Research and innovation, Taxation","euInitiatives":"digital  policy,  innovation policy, competition, trade, taxation, telecommunications, energy policy","lastUp":"2019-08-09T20:49:24.957+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
