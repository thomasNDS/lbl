It represents a tourism sector with an estimate of 500.000 micro-enterprises and about 5-6,5 million bed places. The product includes from the rural Bed&amp;Breakfast and self-catering in private homes or farms, up to small family-run rural hotels and guesthouses, restaurants, and activity tourism services.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The objectives of EuroGites are wide-spread, given the character of this sector as based on micro-enterprises or complementary activity which require support and representation in multiple areas. Our statutes define the main tasks and activities of the Federation as follows:&#xd;<br />• information and communication network amongst the member organisations and on international level&#xd;<br />• professional representation in European organisations (private and public)&#xd;<br />• harmonisation of information content and terminology&#xd;<br />• definition of common quality criteria and standards, with the final objective of a common branding and marketing on European level&#xd;<br />• professional and vocational training, research&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />On the promotional side, access to the member webpages is channelled through the site  www.eurogites.org    General recommendations for a Europe-wide product definition and minimum standards in rural tourism accommodation were formally approved in 2005 and were updated in 2019.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />At the European Union, EuroGites represents rural tourism in the Civil Dialogue Group on Rural Development, in the ERN assembly, steering committee, and in two working groups.
