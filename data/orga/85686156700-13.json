The EWL currently consists of member organisations in all 28 EU Member States and three of the five official-candidate countries as well as 20 European-wide member organisations working on very diverse areas and activities. The EWL represents an overall of more than 2000 organisations. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EWL works towards a vision of a peaceful, social and democratic European Union built on a culture of respect for human rights, equality, peace and solidarity, in Europe and globally, where women and men have equal rights, full enjoyment of their personal integrity and choice, an equal share of social, cultural and economic resources, caring and family roles, and are equally represented in decision making.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We believe in a Feminist Europe. We want a holistic, transformational socioeconomic vision, based on well-being, equality, social justice, and a powerful voice against women’s poverty. We envision a culture in which&#xd;<br />women enjoy equal rights and participation in reimagined power and decision-making structures, in which all forms of violence against women has been eliminated, and women have been liberated from all forms of oppression. We envision a society in which women’s contribution to all aspects of life is recognised, rewarded and celebrated - in leadership, in care and in&#xd;<br />production; all women have freedom of choice, self-confidence, and freedom from exploitation; and no woman has been left behind.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are a credible source of expertise and experience on women’s rights and equality between women and men, representing the diversity of the women’s movement across the European Union. We represent an inclusive,&#xd;<br />confident, loud, independent feminist voice and bring real women’s voices into the EU political arena. We build consensus and mobilise our members’ collective experience to work on major issues affecting women, to realise women’s rights, equality between women and men and social justice. We act as a catalyst connecting different actors and organisations to bring change at EU&#xd;<br />level.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We work together with our members at predominantly the European but also the national level in order to achieve equality between women and men in all areas of public and private life; actively address issues of economic and social justice and independence for women; work towards the equal representation of women and men in decision-making, and safeguarding women’s human rights including the eradication of male violence against women. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EWL functions within democratic, open and transparent procedures of communication, decision-making and accountability, including financial accountability. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The European Women’s Lobby monitors and inputs into important political processes at the European Union level, which are relevant for women’s rights including those policy adaptations and innovations required by the radical economic and social changes of the national, EU and world context. We aim to reflect the intersectional nature of women’s needs, in all their diversity, in order for these to be addressed and mainstreamed into all policies and all aspects of socio-political and economic life, and we politically advocate for a dual approach combining specific measures for women’s rights and thorough transformative gender mainstreaming. In our work we will also insist on critically challenging culturally inherited gender stereotypes, and the images detrimental to gender equality between women and men we are confronted with in different ways on a daily basis, and make political interventions as relevant.","acronym":"EWL","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Budget, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and Technology, Sport, Youth","euInitiatives":"- 2012/0299 (COD): DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL&#xd;<br />on improving the gender balance among non-executive directors of companies listed on&#xd;<br />stock exchanges and related measures&#xd;<br />-\t2008/0193(COD) directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tCOM(2010) 491 final, COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS, Strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\t2008/0140 (CNS) COUNCIL DIRECTIVE on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tDIRECTIVE 2011/36/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\t COM(2010) 2020 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION EUROPE 2020 A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2004/113/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tDIRECTIVE 2006/54/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (recast)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tPublic consultation on the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tPublic consultation on the European Commission’s strategy for equality between women and men, April 2015&#xd;<br />Public consultation on the European Commission’s strategy for work-life balance 2015","lastUp":"2018-03-23T09:03:33.025+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1000000-1249999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
