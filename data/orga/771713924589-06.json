We provide a robust, holistic measurement tool, the Social Progress Index, which captures how well a society provides its people with the things they really care about, including health, safety, shelter, education, rights and freedom. The economic measures our world relies on only tell half the story. We tell the other half, equipping leaders in business, government and civil society with a common language of inclusive development and new tools to guide their initiatives.","acronym":"SPI","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Banking and financial services, Budget, Business and Industry, Communication, Competition, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Youth","euInitiatives":"The EU Regional Social Progress Index aims to measure social progress for each region as a complement to traditional measures of economic progress. As it is intended to complement measures based on GDP, income or employment, such indicators are excluded from the index. Measuring social progress can inform the development strategies of EU regions. Please note that this index is not created for the purpose of funding allocation and does not bind the European Commission.","lastUp":"2019-04-30T13:12:09.209+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
