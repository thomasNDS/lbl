Our principals have been working in algorithmic trading as far back as 1980.&#xd;<br />We have been publishing research and giving our time to industry working groups since and meeting regulators since 2003 (MiFID I consultations) to try to help inform legislative proposals.&#xd;<br />we met with regulators to SUPPORT ESMA's Final Report Draft Regulatory and Implementing Technical Standards for MiFID II/MiFIR proposals on Non-Live Testing of algorithms for propensity to cause or contribute to market disorder.&#xd;<br />We are discussing our research and demonstrating AlgoGuard, software which can help investment firms cost effectively fulfill the new requirements on disorderly market testing set out in RTS6 and RTS7. This software is an enhancement of a platform deployed at a major regulated exchange since 2012. &#xd;<br />Had AlgoGuard been in use on US exchanges in 2010 it should have prevented all the algorithms which have been identified as majorly responsible for the flash crash from ever having traded in live markets.&#xd;<br />Our main motivation is to make the markets safer, fairer and less likely to be subject to more restrictive legislation in the future. We are aware that some industry groups have argued that effective non-live disorderly market testing is not possible. We wish to demonstrate that it is not only possible but practical and that at least one such system exists today.","acronym":"","interests":"Banking and financial services, Economy, finance and the euro","euInitiatives":"MiFID II&#xd;<br />We work on other via industry working groups but MiFID II is the only one on which we engage directly","lastUp":"2018-09-20T09:08:48.785+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":""}
