It aims at representing and defending the interests of the farmhouse and artisan cheese and dairy sector, which is composed of businesses processing milk from cow, goat, buffalo and sheep, at a small-scale, and mostly, in the following two types of premises:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\t\"Farmhouse\" premises, which belong to farms and which process milk from at least the majority of their own livestock according to traditional methods&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\t\"Artisan\" premises, which collect milk from local farmers and process it in small structures according to traditional methods&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In both cases, they generally enter in the definition of “microenterprises”, according to Commission Recommendation C(2003) 1422. They are family businesses, which make locally recognized products based on traditional, specific know-how. These businesses are economically profitable and are often a major support for difficult rural territories where dairy farming is one of the only possible activities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />FACEnetwork and it members organisations aim at preserving, developing and promoting the diversity and richness of farmhouse and artisanal cheeses in Europe. FACEnetwork is the “spokesperson” for farmhouse and artisanal cheese-makers at European level:&#xd;<br />recognizing that European legislation may have an impact, whether positive or negative, on the activities of its members, FACEnetwork is committed to follow the relevant activities of the European institutions to ensure that its sector’s interests are taken into account. This will contribute to a better functioning and development of the “small cheese makers” sector within the European Union.","acronym":"FACEnetwork","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Consumers, Education and training, Food Safety, Regional Policy","euInitiatives":"FFACEnetwork notably works on food safety, food labelling and presentation, food legislation, all this, when it concerns farmhouse and artisan cheese and dairy products. We also are interested by issues on animal health and welfare and more generally speacking, on biodiversity.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since 2014, FACEnetwork is member of two of the DG Agri’s Civil Dialogue Groups: the \"milk\" group and the \"promotion and food quality\" group. In both groups, it participated to topics related to “nutritional labelling” and to “labelling of origin or place of provenance of the ingredients”.","lastUp":"2019-03-29T08:40:25.255+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
