Like other Save the Children organisations, its members work with and for children in their own countries and abroad. The principle of children's rights lies at the heart of Save the Children Europe, which aims to help further children's rights in Europe and elsewhere by promoting children's interests in European policy making, funding and programmes.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Save the Children is the world's largest independent organisation for children. We employ approximately 25,000 people across the globe and work on the ground in over 100 countries to help children affected by crises, or those that need better healthcare, education and protection. We also campaign and advocate at the highest levels to realise children’s rights and ensure their voices are heard. We are working towards 3 breakthroughs in how the world treats children by 2030:&#xd;<br />1) No child dies from preventable causes before their 5th birthday&#xd;<br />2) All children learn from a quality basic education&#xd;<br />3) Violence against children is no longer tolerated&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Save the Children believes every child deserves a future. Around the world, we give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. We do whatever it takes for children – every day and in times of crisis – transforming their lives and the future we share. In 2016, we reached over 56 million children directly through our and our partners' work.
