Toward this end, Mentor established the Forum for EU-US Legal-Economic Affairs in 1989.  This peer group of EU and US Supreme Court Justices, European Union Commissioners and their US counterparts, and corporate Chief Legal Officers meets twice annually in Europe to discuss concrete legal-economic developments between the European Union and the United States.  Collective findings inform members’ autonomous decisions in the future.","acronym":"","interests":"Banking and financial services, Business and Industry, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Energy, Enlargement, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"Cutting across jurisdictions and sectors, the Forum for EU-US Legal-Economic Affairs covers EU and US competition law; antitrust fines, compliance and their judicial control; IP rights, innovation and competition; EU privacy legislation, data protection and markets; EU due process protection.","lastUp":"2019-04-29T21:32:11.361+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"600000-699999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
