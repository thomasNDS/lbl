ENAR combats racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and promotes equality of treatment between European Union citizens and third country nationals.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ENAR’s vision is of a society that embraces the necessity of equality and diversity and the benefits of a racism-free Europe for a vibrant European society and economy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are the voice of the anti-racist civil society in European debates, and we aim to ensure that policy developments on equality and diversity are put into practice. We urge the EU and its Member States to adopt a progressive and human rights-based approach to migration and integration, and to respect the principles of equal treatment and equal opportunity for third country nationals. We also take steps to advance the social inclusion of ethnic and religious minorities, focusing on four witness communities: Migrants, Roma, People of African descent, Jewish, and Muslim communities. In addition, ENAR strives to counter and delegitimise populist and xenophobic discourses, and to combat hate crime and hate speech. We provide and emphasise positive discourses on diversity. Our Equal@Work initiative brings together employers, anti-racist civil society, and other relevant stakeholders to share best practices and solutions to increase ethnic and religious minorities’ and migrants’ participation in the labour market.","acronym":"ENAR","interests":"Borders and Security, Budget, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Migration policies (including Bue Card), counter-terrorism Directive, employment initiatives, Social pillar, anti-discrimination and anti-racism policies, fundamental rights.","lastUp":"2020-01-07T12:48:48.975+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
