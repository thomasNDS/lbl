The team of 30+ consultants in Berlin, Brussels and Frankfurt advises clients on regulatory affairs, EU competition and all aspects of stakeholder interaction. &#xd;<br />We advise companies on how political, social and economic developments can impact their business model and how to strategically position in this context. This includes support in promoting legitimate interests and recommendations for optimal organisational structures in the areas Governmental Relations and Corporate Affairs. Our consulting approach is based on following principles:&#xd;<br />• Societal trends not only require companies to permanently reassess their market position and, where necessary, adjust their business model, they also offer new business and growth opportunities.&#xd;<br />• Positioning companies strategically requires pro-active commitment to good corporate citizenship.&#xd;<br />• Only an integrated stakeholder approach that consistently targets all parties critical to corporate success creates a solid foundation for sustainable corporate success.&#xd;<br />• On-going monitoring of the political and regulatory environment and the credible promotion of legitimate interests secure the \"licence to operate\" and create new business and growth opportunities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are active in following segments:&#xd;<br />• Corporate Strategy: We analyse the impact of a company's political, societal and corporate environment on its business model and develop possible approaches that reduce potential risks while creating new opportunities.&#xd;<br />• Strategic positioning: We advise companies regarding the strategic positioning in the political and societal landscape.&#xd;<br />• Public Affairs M&amp;A: Social and political goodwill have become a critical success factor for M&amp;A transactions. Of particular importance is the political dimension of merger control procedures in major cross-border transactions.&#xd;<br />Competition and trade cases: Cartels and market abuses, state aid and trade disputes – the result of competition procedures by the EU Commission are of enormous importance to the affected companies and industry sectors. In order to be successful, a sensible political and communication approach alongside the formal legal procedure is key. &#xd;<br />• Advocacy: We support companies in credibly promoting legitimate interests by engaging with policy makers, regulators and the public.&#xd;<br />• CEO positioning / CEO Start: We advise clients in developing suitable strategies for the positioning of CEO’s and their companies. &#xd;<br />• Structural Review:We help companies to optimally align their organisation and processes with the needs of external and internal stakeholders.&#xd;<br />• Corporate social responsibility: We advise companies in developing and implementing tailored, credible CR strategies.","acronym":"HSCA","interests":"Banking and financial services, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Transport","euInitiatives":"Competition, trade, taxation, Digital Single Market, Capital Markets Union, Financial Markets Regulation, Energy Union, Circular Economy, consumer policy, transport","lastUp":"2019-04-16T16:21:22.433+02:00","customers":"Intuitive Surgical","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"800000-899999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":""}
