We do this by&#xd;<br />taking an integrated approach; looking at&#xd;<br />the wider context and causes of their needs&#xd;<br />and promoting sustainable, development&#xd;<br />outcomes. We are determined to empower&#xd;<br />marginalised people with a strong voice&#xd;<br />that argues powerfully for the change they&#xd;<br />need to transform their lives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Right across the Islamic Relief global family,&#xd;<br />our strategy focuses our resources, planning&#xd;<br />and programming on achieving these&#xd;<br />important aims.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We will continue to work in partnership&#xd;<br />with those that share our vision of a world in&#xd;<br />which empowered and socially responsible&#xd;<br />communities respond as one to the&#xd;<br />suffering of others. We will also continue to&#xd;<br />develop as an excellent service provider&#xd;<br />and policy leader, representing our faith&#xd;<br />and providing guidance on a range of critical&#xd;<br />social issues.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Exemplifying our Islamic values, we will mobilise&#xd;<br />resources, build partnerships, and develop local&#xd;<br />capacity, as we work to:&#xd;<br />- Enable communities to mitigate the effect of&#xd;<br />disasters, prepare for their occurrence and&#xd;<br />respond by providing relief, protection and&#xd;<br />recovery.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Promote integrated development and&#xd;<br />environmental custodianship with a focus on&#xd;<br />sustainable livelihoods.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />- Support the marginalised and vulnerable to&#xd;<br />voice their needs and address root causes of&#xd;<br />poverty.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We allocate these resources regardless of race,&#xd;<br />political affiliation, gender or belief, and without&#xd;<br />expecting anything in return.","acronym":"IRW","interests":"Agriculture, Climate Action, Communication, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, General and Institutional Affairs, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"Contribution towards EU policies and legislative issues is conducted through NGO Voice and CONCORD.
