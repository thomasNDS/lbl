They join together as a global community showcasing a new business model that can prioritise a social mission.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Fair Trade Enterprises can be social enterprises, cooperatives, family-businesses and social businesses. They have all adopted practices and structures that give priority to workers, farmers and artisans in their business decisions. They were born as alternative models of business in the struggle against inequality and injustice.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />A Fair Trade Enterprise has Fair Trade as its identity. This means a full commitment to the 10 principles of Fair Trade as their core mission. WFTO members have been assessed by their peers and have been independently audited to confirm this. The WFTO Standard looks at every aspect of a business and confirms whether it is truly a Fair Trade Enterprise. The WFTO verifies that the entire business and its systems for managing their supply chains have embraced Fair Trade.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The WFTO label is the symbol of Fair Trade enterprise. Verified WFTO members use the label to tell consumers, customers and their communities about their identity as a verified Fair Trade enterprise. As members, many can use the WFTO label on their products.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />WFTO has a vision of a world in which trade structures and practices have been transformed to work in favour of the poor and promote sustainable development and justice. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />WFTOâ€™s mission is to enable producers to improve their livelihoods and communities through Fair Trade.  WFTO is the global network and advocate for Fair Trade, ensuring producer voices are heard.
