It is an umbrella organization of interest groups that represent Austrian, Bavarian, Hessian and South Tyrolean medium-sized energy companies. EVME combines the interests of these companies and operates throughout Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />This newly founded association understands itself as an interest group that operates in addition to the traditional interest groups. Its goal is to represent medium-sized energy companies in Brussels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The constitution of a European association was necessary as it became obvious that Brussels was not sufficiently informed about the excellent services which medium-sized energy companies provide in their local communities. Especially medium-sized companies most often satisfy their customers in terms of efficiency, reliability and service. Furthermore, they are locally rooted important regional employers, and they heavily contribute to regional value creation.","acronym":"EVME","interests":"Energy","euInitiatives":"Winterpaket, PSI-RL, Energiepakete 1-3, Network Codes, Implementierung von Smart Metern in Europa, Gesetzgebung in energierechtlichen Fragen, EC Regulation on trans-European Energy Infrastructure, Water Frame Directive, Ecoligical Flow, Electricity Market Design, Network Codes, EU-DSO-Entity","lastUp":"2020-01-03T15:32:45.718+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
