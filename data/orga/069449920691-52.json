Every 8 seconds, an ATR turboprop takes off or lands somewhere around the world.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ATR is strongly committed in aviation safety enhancement. ATR also supports the development of a sustainable European aviation industry, in both economic and environmental terms. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ATR manufactures two sizes of turboprop aircraft, the 70-seat ATR 72 and the 50-seat ATR 42. Both aircraft benefit from fuel, emissions and cost efficiencies provided by turboprop engines. ATR turboprops provide airlines with the best opportunities for operating short-haul routes at a low operating cost. Airlines servicing smaller markets desperately need more fuel efficient-aircraft to continue operating regular flights between regional airports and to main airports and hubs.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ATR offers an unrivalled trip cost, with notably the lowest fuel consumption and CO2 emission in the market, reflecting ATR’s commitment for environmental protection. ATR's aircraft benefit from fuel, emissions and cost efficiencies provided by turboprop engines. Turboprop engines are easier to maintain than jets and less likely to experience foreign object damage. Turboprops require remarkably little runway for takeoff and landing, providing the unique flexibility to serve airports with shorter runways.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1 aircraft out of 4 is a regional aircraft. Regional aviation provides an essential diversity to the whole network, feeding traffic, opening new routes, anchoring airline brands in many areas where air link is essential to live and develop.","acronym":"ATR","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Energy, Environment, Institutional affairs, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"ATR closely monitors EU initiatives, policies and legislative initiatives that can impact its activity.
