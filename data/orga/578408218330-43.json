It has a forward-looking approach and operates as a think-tank, identifying issues as they emerge.&#xd;<br />The OSE is a partner organisation in several European Framework Programmes and is actively involved in some major networks of academic excellence in Europe and North America.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The OSE works closely with the Belgian and European public authorities, as well as with trade unions (including in the context of TURI, a network of research institutes close to the trade unions) and civil society organisations. As a result, it has acquired specialist, in-depth knowledge on the social dimension of European integration and a profound understanding of the European context. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Following a decision of the federal government in July 2014, the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office has recognised the OSE as ‘Scientific Institution’, thereby acknowledging the quality of its independent research.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The OSE’s main goals are to produce independent and state-of-the-art critical analysis of the social dimension of European integration. This implies, more concretely, that we:&#xd;<br />· Analyse the impact of European integration on social and employment policies both at EU level and within the Member States.&#xd;<br />· Conduct research, formulate policy proposals and produce training toolkits.&#xd;<br />· Provide an ongoing platform for discussion for a wide range of stakeholders, esp. trade union organisations.&#xd;<br />· Widely disseminate the results of our reflections through our website, Newsletters, publications (incl. the OSE Working Papers Series), social media (Twitter and LinkedIn) and events.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The OSE consists of a multidisciplinary and multilingual team of researchers and analysts – bolstered by research associates and by interns from all over Europe and North America.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The OSE team:&#xd;<br />· Has a variety of expertise in cross-cutting areas such as economic and monetary union and its impact on the social dimension of European integration, institutional&#xd;<br />issues and the EU’s social policy-making mechanisms (including policy coordination, EU legislation, social dialogue and EU funding).&#xd;<br />· Is able to draw upon a broad-based network of public authorities, (academic and other) researchers, think-tanks, European and national trade unionists, social&#xd;<br />partner representatives and other social stakeholders.&#xd;<br />· Has more than 20 years of expertise in organizing both major (amongst other things, within the framework of the Belgian Presidencies of the EU in 2001 and 2010) and smaller events (incl. the OSE Lunchtime sessions).&#xd;<br />· Can draw on in-house resources, which include our website; our three-monthly Newsletter; our Health Care Newsletter (in English, French and Dutch); our Working Paper series (Research, Briefing and Opinion papers); our Lunchtime Sessions; our LinkedIn page and Twitter account.","acronym":"OSE","interests":"Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, General and Institutional Affairs, Public Health, Regional Policy, Youth","euInitiatives":"- The social dimension of the EU's economic governance (incl. the Social Dimension of EMU and the socialisation of the European Semester);&#xd;<br />- Contract welfare in the European Union: the changing role of social partners;&#xd;<br />- National welfare state reforms and the crisis;&#xd;<br />- The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP);&#xd;<br />- The EU's anti poverty strategy, incl. the European Platform against Poverty;&#xd;<br />- The Pillar of Social Rights","lastUp":"2018-07-25T11:35:47.255+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"800000-899999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
