It has 20 years of experience supporting national peacebuilding and statebuilding, and currently works in 20 fragile and conflict-affected countries and regions in Africa, Asia, Central America, Europe and the Middle East. It works exclusively with national peacebuilding teams that comprise over 300 peacebuilders worldwide.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Interpeace has played a leading role over the past 20 years in the conceptual and operational development of the peacebuilding field.  It began as a United Nations (UN) pilot project in 1994 aimed at better understanding how the international community could improve its support to building peace in countries emerging from conflict.  Today it is a Swiss Association and continues its unique partnership with the UN, engaging with and contributing to the UN peacebuilding architecture at various levels. Interpeace has an agreement with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) that enables it to support UN field agencies and teams in the development of initiatives that use Interpeace’s peacebuilding know-how.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Interpeace works primarily at the national level with the understanding that effective change must also connect to regional and international levels. Based on its knowledge and expertise, Interpeace supports the international community in rendering its engagements in peacebuilding and statebuilding in fragile countries more effective. It offers a different voice at the policy level by drawing on its operational experience from around the world, and puts an emphasis on ensuring that local perspectives are available to and taken into account by policy-makers.","acronym":"Interpeace","interests":"Borders and Security, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Youth","euInitiatives":"EU Funding instruments (EIDHR, IcSP, DCI, EDF, CSO-LA)&#xd;<br />EU strategic framework on Democracy &amp; Human Rights&#xd;<br />EU Global Security Strategy&#xd;<br />EU Joint Communication on Resilience&#xd;<br />Integrated Approach&#xd;<br />EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa&#xd;<br />European Neighborhood Policy","lastUp":"2019-02-25T10:06:20.861+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
