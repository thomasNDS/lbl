Collectively, the Danish wind turbine owners are the largest power producer in the country, producing electricity equal to 43% of the Danish power consumption in 2017. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Members are project developers, cooperations, power companies, farmers and private owners of wind turbines â€“ both single owners and members of wind turbine cooperatives. The membership also include companies and individuals with a general interest in wind energy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The association was founded in 1978 to solve the shared challenges of the first wind turbine owners in relation to the public authorities, electric companies, and wind turbine manufacturers. In 2017 the association had more than 3,000 active members. Most are wind turbine owners, but also many people interested in the exploitation of wind for the purpose of producing energy have joined. Through the memberships of the wind turbine cooperatives, more than 30,000 individuals are represented by the Danish Wind Energy Association. Its members own and operate 3,700 MW of wind power capacity, including 75% of total installed onshore and offshore wind capacity in Denmark. The members collectively generate one third of Denmarks electricity.","acronym":"DWEA","interests":"Climate Action, Competition, Energy, Environment, General and Institutional Affairs, Single market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"All energy-related initiatives, in particular initiatives on electricity market design, energy market integration, renewable energy policies.&#xd;<br />All climate-related initiatives, in particular the European Emissions Trading Scheme, ETS.&#xd;<br />Competition policy, in particular the State Aid guidelines for environmental protection and energy and cross-border trade in electricity.","lastUp":"2018-09-13T09:40:05.511+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
