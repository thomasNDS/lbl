Operating trains requires teamwork, and administration is usually implemented through organisations whose constitutions prohibit the distribution of profit, thus ensuring that any surplus is reinvested in the heritage railway.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />What is FEDECRAIL?&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In many countries, these voluntary bodies have banded together to form umbrella organisations to promote their common interests on a national level. These in turn have joined forces to form FEDECRAIL, the European Federation of Museum and Tourist Railways.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />FEDECRAIL is constituted under the Belgian law. Its members are the national umbrella organisations from European countries but also include, in those countries where none yet exists, some individual railway or museum organisations. Under its constitution, it is governed by a Council of at least six elected representatives from different European countries. It holds a general meeting once a year preceded by a conference on topics of interest to operators of heritage railways, which is attended by delegates from member organisations from all over Europe as well as observers from other continents.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Aims and Objectives of FEDECRAIL&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />FEDECRAIL seeks to:&#xd;<br />* Promote the rescue, restoration and operation of Europe's railway heritage.&#xd;<br />* Represent its members' interests vis-a-vis international agencies and, in particular, the European institutions.&#xd;<br />* Encourage the exchange of ideas across national and cultural boundaries and foster co-operation between museum and tourist railway organisations including museums involved in railway heritage.&#xd;<br />* Help provide advice and assistance for such organisations.&#xd;<br />* Study and resolve problems shared in restoring and operating heritage railways.","acronym":"FEDECRAIL","interests":"Culture, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Transport policy, in praricular for the railway sector.&#xd;<br />Tourism policy in regard to industrial heritage.","lastUp":"2018-07-09T23:49:52.238+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
