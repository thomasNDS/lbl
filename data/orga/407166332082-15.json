We apply strong project management and technical expertise to take new products quickly and cost effectively from late stage pre-clinical through to the end of phase III clinical trials and supporting initial commercial supplies. We have built a reputation for specialising in the formulation of New Chemical Entities that exhibit poor solubility and bio-availability and for novel formulation of biologicals for oral delivery. Building on this expertise Quay has expanded it’s offering into the live biotherapeutics area helping companies exploit the potential of using the body’s natural microbiome to treat or prevent the development of disease. Quay are currently the only service provider who is licensed by both the MHRA and FDA for the clinical manufacture of live biotherapeutics.","acronym":"","interests":"Public Health, Research and innovation, Trade","euInitiatives":"Maireadh Pedersen and Ryan Wilson will be visiting Brussels to have meeting with various EU Institutions and agencies and intend to apply under H2020 Funding. Having established a niche position in the formulation and clinical manufacture of solid and semi solid dosage forms for the delivery of live biotherapeutics, Quay now faces the challenge of being able to support larger clinical phases and commercial supplies and investment in larger scale facilities is on-going. The live biotherapeutic companies are also facing the challenge of finding facilities and companies who can support the GMP capacity through to commercialisation. The ability to translate these products in to larger scale solutions is challenging across the whole supply chain of drug substance and finished product. Due to capacity restraints, lack of GMP facilities due to handling and engineering difficulties around contamination and environmental controls surrounding the handling of BSL2 microbes.  It is Quay’s goal to build a dedicated facility to support the supply chain through to commercialisation in order to guarantee capacity, quality and speed to market for the multiple biotech companies looking to supply these medications. Having a clear route to market will encourage further development work and investment in medical and diagnostic microbiome innovation in Europe.","lastUp":"2018-07-17T16:59:11.160+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
