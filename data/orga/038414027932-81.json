Realizing that there is a distinct lack of a relationship between the emerging island nations in the Eastern Caribbean and the actively developed Southeast Asian countries, the Chamber hopes to be instrumental to bridge this important gap. More importantly, understanding the great and successful partnerships that the EU has with both these regions, it is but natural for the Chamber to take part and observe in the ongoing relationships and activities between the EU and these two economic regions.","acronym":"ECSEACHAMBER","interests":"Climate Action, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, External Relations, International co-operation and development, Trade","euInitiatives":"As of this writing, our organization will concentrate on the observation in EU initiatives with regards to these two sub-regions.","lastUp":"2018-07-10T14:19:35.454+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
