CARE will be a global force and partner of choice within a worldwide movement dedicated to ending poverty. We will be known everywhere for our unshakeable commitment to the dignity of people.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our Mission&#xd;<br />CARE’s mission is to serve individuals and families in the poorest communities in the world. Drawing strength from our global diversity, resources and experience, we promote innovative solutions and are advocates for global responsibility. We promote lasting change by: &#xd;<br />1.\tStrengthening capacity for self-help&#xd;<br />2.\tProviding economic opportunity&#xd;<br />3.\tDelivering relief in emergencies&#xd;<br />4.\tInfluencing policy decisions at all levels&#xd;<br />5.\tAddressing discrimination in all its forms&#xd;<br />Guided by the aspirations of local communities, we pursue our mission with both excellence and compassion because the people whom we serve deserve nothing less.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CARE International&#xd;<br />CARE International works closely with the various institutions of the European Union. Communication takes place with the European Commission’s Directorates General on Development (DG DEVCO) which formulates development policy and implements it; and on humanitarian crises (ECHO). We also work in close contact with the European Members of Parliament (MEPs). Efforts to influence policies of individual Member States are done in collaboration with CARE International members in the EU countries concerned. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />CARE International is committed to transparency about EU interest representation. CARE International believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide EU lobbying transparency. When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of CARE International, carry out out such activities.&#xd;<br />Our registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU.
