The roots of the paritarianism go back to the 19th century but until 20 years ago, the incentives to develop a pan-European paritarian framework have not been conclusive. In the field of social protection, paritarian institutions are non-profit bodies, jointly managed by social partners. The governance of the paritarian institutions is based on the equal representation of both employers and employees. &#xd;<br />Paritarian institutions manage social protection funds set up through collective agreements at the company, the industry-wide or the inter-sectoral level and they can provide a series of social benefits like pensions, health insurances, paid holidays, unemployment and disability. &#xd;<br />The combined funds managed by the paritarian institutions across Europe raise up to 1.3 trillion euro in assets and cover about 80 million people.","acronym":"AEIP","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Business and Industry, Consumers, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, Public Health, Single market, Taxation","euInitiatives":"1.
