Any financial surplus will be reinvested in the member organisation, in research and facilities in order to improve transfusion medicine practices and for the benefit of the community it serves.&#xd;<br />Sustainable, Safe and Secure Plasma&#xd;<br /> IPFA brings together organisations working in different regions of the world with differing health care systems. They are united by the common principles of not-for-profit activity and the voluntary non-remunerated donation, in the belief that these principles form the basis for a sustainable, safe and secure supply of blood and plasma derived medicinal products to meet patients' needs in their communities and countries.&#xd;<br />Our main priority is to maximise the availability of plasma recovered from whole blood donations. Donations of plasma obtained via plasmapheresis techniques are an important and additional source of plasma for the manufacture of plasma-derived medicinal products.&#xd;<br />Plasma fractionation and market developments&#xd;<br /> IPFA considers patients and the hospitals to be the key stakeholders for the industrial preparation of plasma products from donated plasma. Increasing clinical need will continue to drive the national and global market for plasma products. IPFA monitors such market developments and shares information with its member organisations and stakeholders.","acronym":"IPFA","interests":"Education and training, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"-Revision Blood Directive&#xd;<br />-Plasma&#xd;<br />-Plasma products&#xd;<br />-Paediatric regulation&#xd;<br />-Orphan drug regulation&#xd;<br />-EMA policies 043-070&#xd;<br />-REACH","lastUp":"2019-02-19T16:50:36.525+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
