In other words provide the ground where existing ERA relevant activities from the Alliance partners are brought together and conducted in a coordinated way.&#xd;<br />b) Helping to bring closer, and facilitate more the interaction between, the Alliance partners (e.g. through organising common events, and activities). &#xd;<br />c) Helping towards achieving a more consensual approach to issues and debates on European and world transport research issues. &#xd;<br />d) Providing a more integrated form of representation for the transport research providers of Europe towards the EU and its Member States, as well as other entities.  &#xd;<br />e) Supporting, in a horizontal way, the definition of balanced content and priorities in European as well as National transport research programmes with emphasis in  providing adequate support for more “societal value adding” issues as it has been presented in the ETRA Statement of Purpose and Vision document. &#xd;<br />f) Promoting work in areas not directly covered by its partners today, and which can best be achieved through a common approach and joint action.  &#xd;<br />g) Liaising – in full cooperation and alignment with all ETRA  partner Associations - with the European Commission and its advisory bodies and supporting their initiatives. &#xd;<br />h) Helping European Transport research to speak with a more coordinated voice outside of Europe.","lastUp":"2018-08-20T16:28:50.029+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
