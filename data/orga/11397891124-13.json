Peri-urban regions in Europe are facing over-pressure. The balance between sustainable open space, sustainable agriculture and urban spatial and economic dynamics needs to be re-established. There are opportunities as well as challenges for those living and working in peri-urban regions, which should be reflected in tailor-made policies and strategies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />PURPLE is working to raise awareness of the specific peri-urban agenda at European, national and regional levels. At EU level, we feel there has been a lack of recognition in European institutions of the need for specific policies or support for peri-urban regions. Yet they constitute the interface between the 75% of EU citizens living in Europe’s urban areas and the adjacent countryside, which is increasingly valued for its local produce and resources, its diverse landscapes, rich cultural heritage and quality of life.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In the longer term, PURPLE regions wish to share experience and best practice with each other and with other regions, designing and developing partnerships for EU projects.","acronym":"PURPLE","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Consumers, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"PURPLE works for greater recognition and understanding of peri-urban issues in EU policy which may impact upon regional and local government.
