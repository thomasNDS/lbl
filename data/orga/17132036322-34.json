This also includes providing parliamentary representatives with materials.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The CCE prepares materials on topical economic issues and refers them to relevant departments as joint proposals of the business community. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Promotion of the economy home and abroad&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />One of the important tasks of the Chamber is the improvement of economic co-operation with foreign countries. This is achieved through various activities aimed at increasing the exchange of goods and services, and also at making improvements in all other forms of economic co-operation with business actors abroad.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Chamber pays special attention to promotional activities through which the Croatian economy is represented in the respective country. Specifically, it informs business partners about the laws and regulations of the Republic of Croatia, as well as about possibilities and facilities for investment. The Chamber organizes visits for numerous foreign business representatives. It arranges meetings and concrete business co-operation with business partners abroad. It plays an important role in the promotion of export-oriented activities of the Croatian economy at well-known, leading fairs and shows abroad.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As the chief promoter and organizer of their participation at fairs and exhibitions, the Croatian Chamber of Economy supports its members both organizationally and financially in developing a successful marketing approach to the respective market. This is possible thanks to the CCE’s links with chambers and economic institutions around the world, which enables Croatian companies to establish successful contacts with counterparts in the respective country or region. These activities are carried out in co-operation with county chambers, professional associations and other institutions. The Chamber assists in Croatia’s efforts to follow liberalization trends in global trade in order to ensure fair competitive conditions for exports.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2000, the Croatian Chamber of Economy established its Representative Office in Brussels with the main aim to provide support to the Croatian business sector in the process of European integration and implementation of the rules of the European Single Market.&#xd;<br />The Brussels Representative Office acts as a main link between the Croatian Chamber of Economy in Croatia and the European institutions, associations, organizations and companies in Brussels.
