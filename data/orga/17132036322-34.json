This also includes providing parliamentary representatives with materials.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The CCE prepares materials on topical economic issues and refers them to relevant departments as joint proposals of the business community. The CCE also commissions studies, thus harnessing the professional and scientific communities for the benefit of the economy.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Promotion of the economy home and abroad&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />One of the most important tasks of the Chamber is the improvement of economic co-operation with foreign countries. This is achieved through various activities aimed at increasing the exchange of goods and services, and also at making improvements in all other forms of economic co-operation with business actors abroad.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Chamber pays special attention to promotional activities through which the Croatian economy is represented in the respective country. Specifically, it informs business partners about the laws and regulations of the Republic of Croatia, as well as about possibilities and facilities for investment. The Chamber organizes visits for numerous foreign business representatives. It arranges meetings and concrete business co-operation with business partners abroad. It plays an important role in the promotion of export-oriented activities of the Croatian economy at well-known, leading fairs and shows abroad.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As the chief promoter and organizer of their participation at fairs and exhibitions, the Croatian Chamber of Economy supports its members both organizationally and financially in developing a successful marketing approach to the respective market. This is possible thanks to the CCE’s links with chambers and economic institutions around the world, which enables Croatian companies to establish successful contacts with counterparts in the respective country or region. These activities are carried out in co-operation with county chambers, professional associations and other institutions. The Chamber assists in Croatia’s efforts to follow liberalization trends in global trade in order to ensure fair competitive conditions for exports.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2000, the Croatian Chamber of Economy established its Representative Office in Brussels with the main aim to provide support to the Croatian business sector in the process of European integration and implementation of the rules of the European Single Market.&#xd;<br />The Brussels Representative Office acts as a main link between the Croatian Chamber of Economy in Croatia and the European institutions, associations, organizations and companies in Brussels. The office supports Croatian companies in different aspects of their business  activity by:&#xd;<br />• Providing information on EU policies, measures and instruments;&#xd;<br />• Offering our members relevant information on placing their products on the European market;&#xd;<br />• Providing information on EU-funding and programmes, open calls and partner search;&#xd;<br />• Assisting with participation in EU-financed projects;&#xd;<br />• Answering inquiries from domestic and foreign companies on different issues such as legislation, public tendering, requirements for establishing&#xd;<br />a company, real estate, business partners etc.;&#xd;<br />The services provided by the CCE Representative Office in Brussels are the result of joint eff orts done by the entire Chamber’s system in Croatia (departments, centers, professional associations and the&#xd;<br />County chambers).","acronym":"HGK","interests":"Agriculture, Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Croatian Chamber of Economy monitored and have been involved in the following topics:&#xd;<br />- Driving and rest time periods, working time &#xd;<br />and posting of workers&#xd;<br />-\tThe Directive on Payment Services (PSD) - Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions&#xd;<br />-\tProposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste to reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags&#xd;<br />-\tDirective on package travel and assisted travel arrangements&#xd;<br />-       Revision of the Posting of Workers Directive&#xd;<br />-\tREFIT – making EU law lighter, simpler and less costly&#xd;<br />-\tRevision of the Commission’s Impact Assessment Guideline&#xd;<br />-\tEEN     Enterprise Europe Network","lastUp":"2018-09-21T10:56:38.816+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
