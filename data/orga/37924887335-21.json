Each project is conceived as an instrument to promote this awareness in everyone involved, has in itself a need for communicating and sharing, and creates an impact capable of generating a positive change.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In project implementation, AVSI uses the following approach:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- to start from the value of the person, who is never defined by the circumstances in which s/he lives&#xd;<br />to consider the person always in his/her family and community context&#xd;<br />- to do with: accompany and let ourselves be accompanied, recognizing that we all share the same human experience&#xd;<br />- to involve all stakeholders: encourage the participation of beneficiaries, providers, partners, donors, and the private sector&#xd;<br />- to learn from experience and capitalize on the lessons learned.","acronym":"","interests":"Communication, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development","euInitiatives":"- New European Consensus on Development and 2030 Agenda (implementation)&#xd;<br />- Migration and Development&#xd;<br />- EU-ACP post-Cotonou&#xd;<br />- Civil Society Organisations' role in development cooperation and EU funding to NGOs/CSOs&#xd;<br />- MFF 2014-2020 Mid-Term review and MFF post 2020&#xd;<br />- ECHO FPA implementation and new FPA &#xd;<br />- EU Trust Funds Africa and Madad (implementation)&#xd;<br />- Joint Programming process&#xd;<br />- Education in development&#xd;<br />- External Investment Plan&#xd;<br />- Youth, vocational training and job creation in external action&#xd;<br />- Women empowerment in external action&#xd;<br />- Urban development and urban planning in external action&#xd;<br />- Private sector in development&#xd;<br />- Child labour, protection","lastUp":"2019-08-26T14:49:29.324+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
