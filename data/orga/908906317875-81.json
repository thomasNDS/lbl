Planting trees can halt global warming by restoring the hydrological process of our planet.&#xd;<br />WeForest is contributing in 3 ways: &#xd;<br />1. Demonstrating it is possible with scalable best practices on the ground (with over 20 million trees to date).&#xd;<br />2. Promoting the scientific exchange and dissemination on the dynamics of global hydrology and trees for climate. WeForest is advancing the forest/water-cycle/climate research by organising high level scientific conferences&#xd;<br />3. Creating a movement with corporate brands (over 350 to date) who use trees as a currency to engage consumers, drawing on marketing and CSR budgets to Make Earth Cooler.","acronym":"WF","interests":"Climate Action, Environment","euInitiatives":"Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and LULUCF in the context of the 2030 EU climate and energy framework","lastUp":"2019-04-23T11:48:00.167+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
