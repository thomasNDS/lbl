In the HEA the municipalities cooperate around education and training on various levels from secondary level for youth, adult education, post secondary VET and higher education. The municipalities within HEA organises education and vocational training for about 5 000 students per year..  HEA makes it possible for the municipalities to offer a broad spectrum of courses that each municipality by itself would be unable to offer due to financial reasons. HEA was established in 2015. The municipalities have participated in numerous projects funded by the EU/ESF all related to lifelong learning and how LLL can be organised in rural areas. The HEA cooperation also focuses on R&amp;D about for example distance learning using ICT technology and appropriate pedagogical methods.&#xd;<br />The HEA is a member of the NITUS, a collaboration between education/VET providers in Sweden about distance higher education.&#xd;<br />The HEA is the regional public body responsible for education for immigrants.&#xd;<br />The HEA has a R&amp;D unit in collaboration with a number of universities.&#xd;<br />The HEA is the national resource centre for UNESCO/UNEVOC: the UN collaboration between VET providers in the world, about 200 centres established bridging north and south together for mutual development of VET.&#xd;<br />The HEA is the only public education provider in Sweden that is accreditated by the Europeactive, www.europeactive.eu, to train and certify PT (Personal Trainers and Group Fitness instructors)","acronym":"HUF","interests":"Development, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Public Health, Sport","euInitiatives":"Erasmus+, EU programme for education, training, youth and sport &#xd;<br />ESF, European Social Found&#xd;<br />”Interreg IV A” (Central Baltic)","lastUp":"2018-02-13T09:45:43.015+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
