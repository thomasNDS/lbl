The overall aim of ENoP’s advocacy work is to put&#xd;<br />the core aspects of political plurality, democratic participation, political dialogue and democratic&#xd;<br />elections high on the agenda of the EU.&#xd;<br /> Effective contribution of Political Foundations from EU member states and their local and&#xd;<br />regional partners to democratic transition and consolidation in partner countries;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Furthermore, our guiding principles encompass the notion of Political Foundations' role asbridge-builders between civil society and political actors:&#xd;<br /> ENoP supports the principle of ownership of development strategies and programmes by&#xd;<br />partner countries&#xd;<br /> ENoP considers it of utmost importance to create instruments and activities which are tailored&#xd;<br />to the specific situation of each partner country&#xd;<br /> Democracy is a complex and long term process. We therefore believe that long-term projects&#xd;<br />are much more effective than single activities and short term activities in partner countries&#xd;<br /> Political Dialogue between different groups in society is at the heart of our democracy support&#xd;<br />approach&#xd;<br /> ENoP supports the EU in its efforts to apply existing EU policies more consistently and&#xd;<br />effectively in order to reach the overall goal of Policy Coherence for Development&#xd;<br /> Enhance capacities of Political Foundations from EU member states to be engaged in political&#xd;<br />dialogue and exchange at local, national, regional and global level. Strengthen visibility of the&#xd;<br />work of Political Foundations at member states and international level;&#xd;<br /> Participation of European political foundations in the European Union’s programmes and&#xd;<br />projects for development cooperation, democracy support and political dialogue;&#xd;<br /> Regular transfer of experience, gained from the international work of political foundations from&#xd;<br />EU member states and their local/regional partners, contributes to the policies and programmes&#xd;<br />of the European Union;&#xd;<br /> Political parties are recognized as an essential element for democratization in donor democracy&#xd;<br />support programs.","acronym":"ENoP","interests":"Budget, Climate Action, Development, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Home Affairs, Regional Policy, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"ENoP is engaging with the EU institutions, primarily with the European Commission (DG DEVCO, DG NEAR), the European Parliament (also DEG Group) and the EEAS (e.g. unit on democracy support). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ENoP participates actively in public consultations when it comes to the EU Development policies, the Agenda 2030, SDG implementation, Revised European Consensus on Development, EU Action Plans on Democracy and Human Rights, revision of financial instruments, such as the EIDHR mid-term reviews, CSO-LAs mid-term review; Pease and Security Instrument mid-term review. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In addition to public consultations, ENoP also takes the initiatives of providing spontaneous inputs and consultation materials on the above-mentioned subjects as well as other relevant areas where the Network holds its expertise. ENoP has provided inputs to visibility manual for development projects in partner-countries, as well as provided recommendations to tailoring financial instruments based on the needs of local development actors. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Furthermore, ENoP participates in a jointly-organised conference on the occasion of the international day of Democracy in September 2017, together with the EEAS, EC, EP and CSO actors in democracy support. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ENoP also provides advisory in bi-lateral meetings with EU institutional representatives, where it presents its expertise as bridge-builder between CSOs and decision makers.","lastUp":"2018-02-26T17:39:33.643+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
