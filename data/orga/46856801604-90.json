We all have the same brand values, the same passion and commitment.  We have joined forces as Oxfam International because we believe we will achieve greater impact by working together in collaboration with others. &#xd;<br />Together we are working towards a world in which people can live with dignity, have their basic needs met and their basic rights respected, and have the ability to control their own lives.&#xd;<br />Together we are working to achieve our vision of ‘a just world without poverty’.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Development&#xd;<br />We work with partners and communities on long-term programs to eradicate poverty and combat injustice. Our development programs address the needs and rights or poor, vulnerable and marginalized people, based on their own initiatives and realities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Emergencies&#xd;<br />Oxfam International is a key actor in the international humanitarian community, alleviating the suffering of millions of people around the world. We respond rapidly to emergencies when people are affected by armed conflicts or natural disasters, providing them with life-saving water and sanitation, emergency shelter and protection.  These efforts on the ground are reinforced by our advocacy work to protect people’s rights in crises. In 2007, more than US$263m $ was spent assisting people affected by disasters.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Campaigning &amp; Advocacy&#xd;<br />Our advocacy and campaigning work is one of the most powerful and effective vehicles by which OI affiliates work together to achieve lasting change for poor women and men. &#xd;<br />Oxfam is part of a global movement for change. We raise public awareness of the causes of poverty and encourage ordinary people to take action for a fairer world. As advocates, we press decision makers in governments and international institutions to change policies and practices that reinforce poverty and injustice.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Policy research&#xd;<br />We can speak with authority as a result of thorough research and analysis, and the real experience of our partners in developing countries.","acronym":"OXFAM INTERNATIONAL","interests":"Agriculture, Budget, Climate Action, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"Oxfam International’s European Union office in Brussels works to influence key decision-makers to ensure that EU policies affecting poor countries have a far reaching, positive impact on the lives of those most in need.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our work spans numerous policy areas including food security, climate change, development policy and finance, and the provision of humanitarian assistance to victims of conflicts and natural disasters.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The EU office works together with Oxfam’s eight European affiliates in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands.
