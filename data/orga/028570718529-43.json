Our more than 300 members, including about 180 city and regional carriers as well as municipal utilities, provide urban as well as rural areas, the so-called \"white spots\", with high-performance fibre access. To this end, they invest more than EUR 1.5 billion every year. BREKO companies thus make a major contribution to the comprehensive fibre deployment in Germany as well as to the achievement of the German Federal Government’s broadband targets.","acronym":"BREKO","interests":"Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, General and Institutional Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Digital Single Market, Telecoms Code, WiFi4EU, Multiannual Financial Framework, Cybersecurity Act, ePrivacy Regulation","lastUp":"2018-10-23T10:06:42.253+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
