Whatever we do under The Forum umbrella, we share the knowledge we create collectively with our members, our strategic alliances and other key stakeholders. This inspires further collaborative actions and participation in industry multi-stakeholder platforms. Here The Forum is acknowledged as the focal point for both gathering and expressing the considered view of our industry, and as the source of transparent and reasonable response to public concerns as they arise.","acronym":"CGF","interests":"Climate Action, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Food Safety, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health","euInitiatives":"Circular economy, Environment, Health and Wellness, Food Safety, Social Sustainability, Supply Chain","lastUp":"2019-05-28T11:18:31.691+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
