The British Geological Survey (BGS) itself was founded in 1835 and is the worldâ€™s longest established national geological survey. BGS seeks to advance the understanding of the structure, properties and processes of the solid Earth system through interdisciplinary surveys, monitoring and research for the benefit of society. BGS  is  a  public  sector  organization  responsible  for  advising  the  UK  government  on  all  aspects  of geosciences, as well as providing impartial geological advice to industry, academia and the public. It is the UK's premier provider of objective and authoritative geoscientific data, information and knowledge for sustainable use of natural resources, reducing risk and living with the impacts of environmental change.&#xd;<br />BGS is the designated NERC National Geosciences Data Centre (NGDC) and is the national UK repository for geosciences data (www.geosciencedatacentre.com) derived from UK industry, international scientific collaboration and academic research. BGS has a range of experienced scientific and technical staff engaged with the collection of all types of geosciences data,  its  processing,  interpretation,  and  archiving  as  well  as  the  production  of  digital  data products. BGS operates a national network of geomagnetic observatories and a seismic network: http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/operations/observatories.html, http://www.quakes.bgs.ac.uk/monitoring/home.html. BGS is also an ISO 9001:2000 accredited organization (cert. FS 71346). The British Geological Survey has extensive experience in co-ordinating and contributing to a number of significant EU-funded initiatives including OneGeology-Europe, the European Plate Observing System Preparatory Phase (EPOS), Geo-Seas and EMODNET. BGS  has  also  taken  an active  role  in international  initiatives  such  as the  Group  on  Earth  Observations (GEO), Research Data Alliance (RDA), Belmont Forum, INTERMAGNET and the World Data System.","acronym":"BGS","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Digital economy and society, Energy, Environment, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Research and innovation, Trade, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Raw Materials Initiative, European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials, Circular Economy","lastUp":"2018-10-03T17:12:28.123+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
