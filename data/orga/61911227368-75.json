We coordinate best practice exchanges between patient organisations at European and national levels. Our programmes also help to strengthen their organisational and advocacy capacity. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPF's goals as stated in the Strategic Plan 2014-2020 are as follows:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 1: HEALTH LITERACY&#xd;<br />To promote access for patients and their informal carers to information and education that enables them to make informed choices about their health.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 2: HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND QUALITY&#xd;<br />To contribute to improvements in health systems that enable equitable access to sustainable and high-quality healthcare designed and delivered to meet patients’ and informal carers’ needs at all levels of care, embracing innovation in all its forms.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 3: PATIENTS’ INVOLVEMENT&#xd;<br />To advance meaningful patient involvement in the development and implementation of health-related policies, programmes and projects in the EU.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 4: PATIENTS' EMPOWERMENT&#xd;<br />To promote the development and implementation of policies, strategies and healthcare services that empower patients to be involved in the decision-making and management of their condition according to their preference, whilst raising awareness about their rights and responsibilities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 5: SUSTAINABLE PATIENTS' ORGANISATIONS&#xd;<br />To support the development, growth and capacity building of inclusive, effective, sustainable and representative patients’ organisations, and to foster cooperation and synergies between them.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 6: NON DISCRIMINATION&#xd;<br />To promote the development of EU and national policies that tackle discrimination faced by patients in health and social care as well as in domains like education and employment.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our vision, core values, and strategic goals stated in our strategic plan inform EPF’s policy and programme work, external communications and collaboration and partnerships with health stakeholders. They are embedded in all activities we undertake and constitute EPF’s identity card. We outline our yearly objectives through an annual work plan.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Link to EPF Strategic Plan: http://www.eu-patient.eu/library/Strategic-Plan/&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Link to EPF Annual Work plans: http://www.eu-patient.eu/library/Other-Material/","acronym":"EPF","interests":"Consumer Affairs, Employment and Social Affairs, Enterprise, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Youth","euInitiatives":"EPF is mainly active in the fields of health and research in relation with the Third Health Programme (Regulation (EU) No 282/2014). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our 2017 work programme builds on the achievements of our 2015 and 2016 programme by addressing the continuum of care with focus on patient-centred chronic disease management, patient empowerment, and equitable access to high quality health and social care. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPF is committed to contributing to the programme’s 4 overarching objectives: &#xd;<br />To promote health, prevent diseases, foster supportive environments for health lifestyles &#xd;<br />To Protect Union citizens from serious CBHC threats, responding to health emergencies&#xd;<br />To support public health capacity-building and contribute to innovative, efficient and sustainable health systems (addressing shortages of resources, both human &amp; financial, facilitating the uptake of innovations in health).&#xd;<br />To facilitate access to better and safer healthcare for Union citizens: access to medical expertise, information&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPF’s 2017 work programme is structured around the three thematic priorities of patient empowerment, access, and sustainable patient organisations (contributing to operational objectives 1, 2, and 3 respectively), which are complemented by cross-cutting activities on dissemination, management and evaluation of the work programme.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPF has monitored the proposal for a regulation on medical devices (2012/0266(COD)). We advocate for safer medical devices, better transparency and information to patients, and meaningful patient involvement in the development process for medical devices. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPF has also followed developments on the General Data Protection Regulation (COM(2012)0011). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2015 we have been monitoring closely the implementation of the Directive 2011/24/EC on patients’ rights in cross border healthcare.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are also monitoring the regulation No 536/2014 on Clinical Trials on medicinal products for human use. In 2015 we have published a position on clinical trials result and communication of the lay summary. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We contribute a patients’ perspective to policy initiatives on patient empowerment, health inequalities/access to healthcare, quality of care, patient safety, ehealth, information to patients, health literacy, health technology assessment, personalised medicines and non-discrimination in employment and education.","lastUp":"2017-09-04T16:18:28.180+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
