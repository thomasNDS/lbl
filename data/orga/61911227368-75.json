We coordinate best practice exchanges between patient organisations at European and national levels. Our programmes also help to strengthen their organisational and advocacy capacity. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EPF's goals as stated in the Strategic Plan 2014-2020 are as follows:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 1: HEALTH LITERACY&#xd;<br />To promote access for patients and their informal carers to information and education that enables them to make informed choices about their health.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 2: HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND QUALITY&#xd;<br />To contribute to improvements in health systems that enable equitable access to sustainable and high-quality healthcare designed and delivered to meet patients’ and informal carers’ needs at all levels of care, embracing innovation in all its forms.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 3: PATIENTS’ INVOLVEMENT&#xd;<br />To advance meaningful patient involvement in the development and implementation of health-related policies, programmes and projects in the EU.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 4: PATIENTS' EMPOWERMENT&#xd;<br />To promote the development and implementation of policies, strategies and healthcare services that empower patients to be involved in the decision-making and management of their condition according to their preference, whilst raising awareness about their rights and responsibilities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 5: SUSTAINABLE PATIENTS' ORGANISATIONS&#xd;<br />To support the development, growth and capacity building of inclusive, effective, sustainable and representative patients’ organisations, and to foster cooperation and synergies between them.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Goal 6: NON DISCRIMINATION&#xd;<br />To promote the development of EU and national policies that tackle discrimination faced by patients in health and social care as well as in domains like education and employment.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our vision, core values, and strategic goals stated in our strategic plan inform EPF’s policy and programme work, external communications and collaboration and partnerships with health stakeholders. They are embedded in all activities we undertake and constitute EPF’s identity card.

In 2015 we have published a position on clinical trials result and communication of the lay summary. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Currently, we are also closely following the developments around the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on health technology assessment and amending Directive 2011/24/EU.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />At the same time, we have been involved in the legislative files of the MFF (ESF+, Horizon Europe, etc) as well as in the different initiatives in the fild of digital health.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We contribute a patients’ perspective to policy initiatives on patient empowerment, health inequalities/access to healthcare, quality of care, patient safety, ehealth, information to patients, health literacy, health technology assessment, personalised medicines and non-discrimination in employment and education.","lastUp":"2019-09-05T17:18:21.692+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
