Many people take care with their performance responsibility in both a personal and a social sense. They get only little recognition of their individual efforts and no financial support for their daily work. The high experience competence of family carers is often not recognized and respected. It is spoken, written and researched scientifically for them and about them. They aren't encouraged to speak for themselves. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The WIR! Stiftung pflegender Angehöriger was founded in 2010 in Germany.&#xd;<br />She promotes the perception of family carers in the society. She wants to make visible the work and the high emotional and financial importance of family carers, often older people in the society. The WIR! Stiftung encourages family carers , to unite municipally, regionally and nationally to bring their experiences, needs and high holistic care competence effectively and independently itself into the society. &#xd;<br />The WIR! Stiftung promotes self-help and calls for an appropriate financial compensation for this important care work. She promotes cooperation between science, business and practice in regard to family caregivers.","acronym":"","interests":"Communication, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"European Innovation Partnershop on Active and Healthy Ageing (AHA), EASPD, NESTA, Euclid Network, Digital Social Innovation, European Social Innovation, AAL Europe, EKTG,","lastUp":"2019-07-18T11:26:35.703+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
