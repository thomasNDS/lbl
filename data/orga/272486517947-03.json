The purpose of Inspire2Live is get cancer under control by 2021. We believe that this is feasible when patients, physicians and scientists work together to share knowledge, data and inspiration together. Currently, there is a very unhealthy competition between faculties, research groups and universities. Inspire2Live brings these various parties together with very well-informed patients. In this context we work to optimize the processes so that new ideas, therapies and treatments are more quickly available to patients in the Netherlands but eventually worldwide.","acronym":"","interests":"Competition, Consumer Affairs, Development, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Enterprise, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and Technology, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Privacy, Gezondheid (Innovatie in de zorg),Voedselveiligheid, Geneesmiddelen (ontwikkeling en veiligheid), Internationale samenwerking in de zorg","lastUp":"2018-04-16T19:50:01.573+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
