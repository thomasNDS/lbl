The purpose of Inspire2Live is get cancer under control by 2021. We believe that this is feasible when patients, physicians and scientists work together to share knowledge, data and inspiration together. Currently, there is a very unhealthy competition between faculties, research groups and universities. Inspire2Live brings these various parties together with very well-informed patients. In this context we work to optimize the processes so that new ideas, therapies and treatments are more quickly available to patients in the Netherlands but eventually worldwide.","acronym":"","interests":"Business and Industry, Competition, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"- Tobacco file&#xd;<br />- Devellopment and patents of new medicines&#xd;<br />- Personalised Medicine&#xd;<br />- HORIZON and IMI project funding","lastUp":"2019-09-21T11:50:08.023+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
