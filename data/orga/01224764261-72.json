EGS promotes the contribution of geosciences to European Union affairs and action programmes to publish, or see its Members publishing, expert, neutral, balanced and practical pan-European technical advice and information for the European Union Institutions. It also provides a permanent network between the Geological Surveys of Europe and a common, but not unique, gateway to each of the Members and their national networks to jointly address European issues of common interest in the field of geosciences. According to its Statutes, EGS shall pursue activities that lie exclusively in the public interest or in the interest of public administration that will benefit from the combined and coordinated expertise of its members and in the direct interest of the European Union and/or of the European Free Trade Association. EGS areas of expertise include:&#xd;<br />- the use and the management of on- and off-shore natural resources related to the subsurface of the Earth, (minerals and water, soils, underground space, land and energy, including the renewable geothermal energy);&#xd;<br />- the identification of natural hazards of geological origin, their monitoring and the mitigation of their impacts (deficit or excess of trace elements in soils and waters, earthquakes natural emissions of hazardous gases, landslides and rock falls, land heave and subsidence, shrinking and swelling clays);&#xd;<br />- environmental management, waste management and disposal, land-use planning;&#xd;<br />- sustainable urban development and safe construction;&#xd;<br />- e-government and the access to geo-scientific metadata and data;&#xd;<br />- the development of interoperable and harmonised geo-scientific data at the European scale.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />After 40 years of intense activity EGS, which saw its origins as a network of National Geological Surveys of Europe, is an organisation which today represents 40 national and regional institutions in 36 countries. These national agencies combined have a total yearly budget of more than one billion euro and a workforce of over 20,000.&#xd;<br />EGS claims several success stories, among others its ability to have become a reference point for the European Union in such topics as: natural resources (water, soils, minerals), geodata, land management and environmental protection and natural risks.&#xd;<br />The Brussels based organisation is organised into Expert Groups integrating all information, knowledge and expertise deriving from all participating countries in fields such as geochemistry, spatial data / INSPIRE, geological hazards, water, Earth observation, energy, carbon capture and storage, marine geology, mineral resources and soils.&#xd;<br />It is in a position to provide the European Commission with answers to the ever-growing specific requests in the public interest. Specifically, the European Commission acknowledges that EGS and its Members have significant roles to play in the definition of some of the most important and recent legislative initiatives and provisions, such as:&#xd;<br />- the \"INSPIRE Directive\",&#xd;<br />- the \"Raw Materials Initiative\",&#xd;<br />- the \"European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials\",&#xd;<br />- the Directive on the geological storage of CO2,&#xd;<br />- the EC's \"Marine Observation and Data Experts Group\",&#xd;<br />- the proposed Directive on the \"promotion of the use of energy from renewable resources\",&#xd;<br />- the \"Water Framework Directive\",&#xd;<br />- The \"Mining Waste Directive\",&#xd;<br />- The European Technology Platform on Geological Disposal of Radioactive Wastes,&#xd;<br />- the \"Proposed Soils Protection Directive\".&#xd;<br />In addition, EGS has built relations with industrial and other organisations operating in the Earth Science sector.","acronym":"EGS","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Transport","euInitiatives":"All policies related to the subsurface space and its resources, such as energy, raw materials, water, marine environment, spatial information and INSPIRE, soils, natural hazards, etc.","lastUp":"2020-01-07T16:08:19.511+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"600000-699999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
