Registered as a non-governmental organisation, it is a go-to entity for everyone with a problem, challenge, question, or project on health education.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />DCHE has close working relations with public authorities like the Ministry of Health, the National Board of Health and private organizations in the health field. The membership organizations are primarily professional associations in the health field and the associations of county councils and local authorities. Sponsored by mainly public health authorities, the Committee develops and produces health promotion material on many themes and to many target groups. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Themes include pregnancy prevention, child and maternity health, sexually transmitted diseases, breastfeeding, child raising, alcohol problems, tobacco cessation, prevention of infectious diseases.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />During the last 10 years DCHE has also gained specific expertice in developing, implementing and evaluating patient education, where the trainers consist of health professionals as well as volunteers of non-health professionals. We have been implementing the programs in almost all 98 municipalities and at several hospitals in Denmark. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />This has also led to the co-founding of the European Network on Patient Empowerment, ENOPE - and also to involvement in a series of European projects related to self-management, self-care, and health literacy.","acronym":"DCHE","interests":"Communication, Consumers, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Food Safety, Public Health, Sport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Health policy &#xd;<br />- on chronic diseases, mental health, maternal and child health, health literacy, prevention, patient empowerment, self-care, self-management, antibiotic resistance, nutrition, smoking cessation - and anything in between.","lastUp":"2018-07-16T12:57:49.936+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
