SPISE &#xd;<br />(Standardized Procedure for the Inspection of Sprayers in Europe) is a voluntary working group established during the first SPISE workshop in 2004. The participants welcomed the thought that a working group should work on further steps for the harmonization and mutual recognition of inspections of PAE. The goal in the meantime is to achieve a common &#xd;<br />procedure for risk assessment, quality management procedures, training courses for inspectors and supporting the &#xd;<br />implementation of a guideline for uniform interpretation/use of the related standards, inspection of brand new sprayers, &#xd;<br />development of guidelines where no harmonized standard is available at the moment and guideline for adjustment of PAE.","acronym":"SPISE WG","interests":"Agriculture, Environment, Food Safety","euInitiatives":"Especially article 8 of the Directive 2009/128/EC concerning the inspection of Pesticide application equipment; &#xd;<br />in connection with this also the Directive 2009/127/EC","lastUp":"2018-08-22T11:13:01.511+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
