The knowledge, staff and technology of the non profit was turned into a privately owned company in 2000. Today, we are market leaders in the field of accessibility and enjoy a close relationship to end user organisations, which ensures a unique level of quality control in everything we do. &#xd;<br />We work with accessibility in digital interfaces in regards of content, design and technology, web, ICT and documents in all possible formats, apps, ticket machines and ATMs, but also signs and other kinds of information. We have a unit focusing on accessibility in the built environment, orientation, acoustics and how to treat and communicate with persons with different abilities.&#xd;<br />Our activities are based on hands on testing, experience and scientific methodology.
