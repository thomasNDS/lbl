The association deals with promotion of slag as a product, enables exchange of information and research as well as facilitates the interaction with governing bodies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Ferrous slag is the by-product of iron and steel manufacturing. It arises from the conversion of ores to iron, hot iron to steel, from melting scrap in an electric arc furnace or from the subsequent treatment of crude steel. Each year, about 45 million tonnes of ferrous slag (iron and steel slag) is generated in Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Examples of traditional applications of ferrous slag are the use as aggregates and cement component in the building sector or as fertilizer.","acronym":"EUROSLAG","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Environment, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"Europäische Abfallrahmenrichtlinie, Europäische Düngemittelverordnung, CLP Verordnung, Wasserrahmenrichtlinie, Bauprodukteverordnung, Circular Economy Package","lastUp":"2019-07-11T14:27:26.789+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
