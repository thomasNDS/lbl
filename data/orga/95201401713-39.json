Its members include: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures; Paramount Pictures Corporation; Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.; Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation; Universal City Studios LLC; and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. Today the association advocates strong protection of the creative works produced and distributed by the audiovisual industry and seeks to promote a responsible internet. The Brussels-based MPA office acts as regional hub for Europe, Middle East and Africa. A large part of our work consists in providing support to local partner organisations active in the EMEA region on content protection and anti-piracy work. Another important part of the mission of the EMEA office is to working with film industries and creative communities throughout the region in pursuit of common interests. EU advocacy and government relations to champion the cause of strong legislation that protects rightholders’ needs and interests constitutes another element of the EMEA’s office work. Lobbying activities - including EU-related outreach - constitutes only a certain portion of the EMEA office's work.","acronym":"MPA","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Economic and Financial Affairs, Enterprise, External Relations, General and Institutional Affairs, Home Affairs, Information Society, Internal Market, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"The MPA monitors the development of EU policies and legislation, notably in the field of Intellectual Property, Culture, Audiovisual Policy, the Internal Market, Competition and the Information Society.
