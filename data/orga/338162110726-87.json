VSO International operates programmes out of more than 20 country offices in Africa, Asia and Pacific. Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) is a company limited by guarantee, registered in England and Wales, with company number 703509. &#xd;\n&#xd;\nVSO is governed by an International Board and an Executive Board.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nInternational Board&#xd;\nVSO’s governing body is the International Board, currently comprising 10 trustees, who are the statutory directors and members of VSO. The International Board meets at least three times a year in person and once by telephone. It has further discussions by telephone if necessary. Face to face meetings typically last for at least one full day, with an additional briefing as necessary to offer the opportunity for further engagement and insight into VSO’s work, and a working dinner with the Executive Board. Trustees are generally appointed for an initial period of three years, which can be extended for a further three-year period.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nExecutive Board&#xd;\nThe International Board delegates VSO’s day-to-day management to the chief executive and the Executive Board. The Executive Board has operational oversight of VSO’s global work. Each member is responsible for an area of VSO’s global operations, including programmes, business development, people and organisational development, and finance and corporate services.&#xd;\nThe Executive Board meets weekly to oversee implementation of strategic and operational activity, allocate resources, set and monitor standards, and determine core approaches to how VSO works. The Executive Board formally reviews achievements against VSO’s development, operational and financial objectives quarterly, in collaboration with senior employees across the organisation.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThere is a formal list of matters reserved for the International Board in VSO’s Schedule of Delegation. The Board is responsible for approving and monitoring implementation of VSO’s long-term strategy, annual corporate business plan, objectives and budget, key policies, constitutional changes and the appointment of the chief executive.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nChanges to VSO’s governance&#xd;\nVSO’s governance had historically involved three separate bodies as provided in the VSO Federation Agreement. These were the International Board, the Federation Council and the UK Board, a sub-committee of the International Board. This complex structure has been simplified to achieve greater accountability, cost effectiveness and clarity in VSO’s governance, and the federation has been disbanded. VSO now has agreements in place for cooperation with VSO Netherlands and VSO Ireland. It has branch offices in Kenya and the Philippines. The UK Board was dissolved in July 2015.","goal":"VSO is the world’s leading independent development organisation that uses volunteers to fight poverty and reduce inequality.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our vision is simple: a world without poverty. Our approach is unique: sending skilled volunteers from sectors such as health, education and business to work with partners who have requested our help. VSO enables a two-way exchange that benefits the volunteers and the community they serve far beyond the life of the volunteer placement. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since 1958 our mission has been to bring people together to fight poverty through the lasting power of volunteering. Our high-impact approach involves bringing people together to share skills, build capacities, promote international understanding and action and change lives to make the world a fairer place. We have improved the capacity of hundreds of NGO partners, and thousands of government staff in health, livelihoods, education and governance work. VSO promotes pro poor policies and works to improve practices through partnership with local communities, local NGOs and government agencies where we work. We believe it is only when people step forward – either as local, national or global citizens – that sustainable change happens. By enabling people and, in turn, their communities to play a more active role in development, volunteering provides the means through which the essential preconditions for sustainable change – ownership, participation, empowerment and inclusion – can be realised. We promote volunteering as a powerful and practical way to tackle poverty and inequality. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We work where we believe we can make the most difference in fighting poverty. I&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our national and international volunteers work with education professionals, health practitioners, entrepreneurs, community leaders, policy makers and activists. By combining volunteers’ diverse and complementary skills and ideas with local knowledge and expertise, we identify and implement innovative solutions to development challenges and campaign for change. This creates an environment for social change by strengthening human capital and local ownership. We work in three thematic areas: education, health and secure livelihoods. These are supported by our cross-cutting themes of gender and social inclusion, social accountability and resilience. These themes are linked to the priorities of our partners overseas, international development targets and our areas of expertise.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Two key elements of change drive VSO’s work:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1) Supporting NGOs and governments to provide relevant and inclusive services&#xd;<br />2) Strengthening civil society through capacity-building and network / coalition-building so communities can hold governments to account, ensuring they develop and implement pro-poor policies.","acronym":"VSO","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Climate Action, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Trade, Youth","euInitiatives":"VSO currently actively follows the following EU initiatives, policies and legislative files:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tThe EU’s development policy, in particular policies related to human development including health and education&#xd;<br />•\tThe EU Aid Volunteers Initiative&#xd;<br />•\tThe implementation of the EU’s Development budget&#xd;<br />•\tThe EU’s policy on private sector involvement in Development","lastUp":"2019-03-14T14:55:53.941+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"400000-499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
