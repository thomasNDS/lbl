We want a society built on laws, free from disproportionate, unaccountable surveillance and censorship. We want a society in which information flows more freely. We want a state that is transparent and accountable, where the public's rights are acknowledged and upheld.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We want a world where we each control the data our digital lives create, deciding who can use it and how. We want the public to fully understand their digital rights, and be equipped to be creative and free individuals. We stand for fit-for-purpose digital copyright regimes that promote free expression and diverse participation in culture.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We believe people have the right to control their technology, and oppose the use of technology to control people.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We uphold human rights like free expression and privacy.  We condemn and work against repressive laws or systems that deny people these rights.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We campaign, lobby, go to court — whatever it takes to build and support a movement for freedom in the digital age. We believe in coalition, and work with partners across the political spectrum to support an informed population of Internet users who understand and fight for their rights in the digital age.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We scrutinise and critique the policies and actions of governments, companies, and other groups as they relate to the Internet. We warn the public when policies — even well-intentioned ones — stand to undermine the freedom to use the Internet to make a better society.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The values that guide us&#xd;<br />We believe in human rights.&#xd;<br />Our work is based on evidence.&#xd;<br />We are accountable to our supporters, and operate with integrity.&#xd;<br />We believe in the importance of empowered people defending digital rights.&#xd;<br />Our work must be accessible and inclusive.&#xd;<br />Background&#xd;<br />Founded in 2005 by 1,000 digital activists, ORG is a non-profit organisation. We have grown with the help of funding from charitable trusts concerned about citizens' rights. However most of our financial support comes from ordinary people, contributing small regular amounts.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ORG has a core staff based in London, headed by Jim Killock, Executive Director.&#xd;<br />Policy is informed by an Advisory Council, consisting of a large group of technology experts, academics and activists who, collectively, have a wealth of experience.&#xd;<br />The running of ORG is overseen by a Board of Directors, two of whom are elected every two years by our paying supporters. None of our Advisory Council members or directors are paid.&#xd;<br />The Supporter Council advises on the Open Rights Group community and campaigns, and represents the voices of the local groups.&#xd;<br />We have a group of legal volunteers, some of whom offer occassional legal advice via our legal panel&#xd;<br />We also depend on a network of campaigning volunteers, including interns working in our office.&#xd;<br />ORG depends on regular contributions from people like you to run and win our campaigns. If you would like to help, why not donate or, better still, join us as an ORG supporter. Or if you run a business or organisation, why not consider becoming a Corporate Supporter.","acronym":"ORG","interests":"Borders and Security, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Foreign affairs and security policy, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and innovation, Single market, Trade","euInitiatives":"Copyright&#xd;<br />Net neutrality&#xd;<br />Data protection &#xd;<br />Digital Single Market&#xd;<br />E-privacy&#xd;<br />Platforms&#xd;<br />Brexit","lastUp":"2019-09-09T17:35:33.814+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
