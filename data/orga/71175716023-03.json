Reynolds. Since then, our international workforce has driven two decades of growth.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Today, we have more than 45,000 employees driving our success all over the world. Our mission is to nurture our internationally recognized brand roster while leading the way in Reduced-Risk Products and new ways of doing business.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are committed to making our business not only the fastest growing of its kind, but also the most innovative and sustainably run.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />JTI recognizes that cigarettes are a legal but controversial product. People smoke for pleasure but there are real risks that come with that pleasure. Accordingly, JTI believes that tobacco products should be appropriately regulated.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We believe in the freedom of adults to choose whether they smoke or not. As much as we value and believe in freedom of choice for adults, we also recognize the importance of making informed decisions. We know we must play our part in ensuring all consumers of tobacco products understand the associated risks when making the decision to smoke or not.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />JTI also believes in the freedom of adults to choose whether they want to smoke and that no one should smoke unless he or she understands the risks of doing so. These risks distinguish tobacco from most consumer goods and they place upon the industry a real responsibility. It's a responsibility for which JTI expects to be held accountable, together with governments and the rest of society.","acronym":"JTI","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Competition, Consumers, Customs, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Single market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"• Directive 2014/40/EU: of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products and repealing Directive 2001/37/EC&#xd;<br />• Directive 2011/64/EC on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco (codification) and Directive 2008/118/EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC.&#xd;<br />• The Trademark Directive (2008/95/EC) and the Community Trademark Regulation (207/2009/EC). &#xd;<br />• Better Regulation&#xd;<br />• International FTAs&#xd;<br />• Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste&#xd;<br />• Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste&#xd;<br />• Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment &#xd;<br />• Proposal for an Inter-Institutional agreement on a mandatory Transparency Register, COM(2016)0627","lastUp":"2019-09-12T14:38:15.812+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1250000-1499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
