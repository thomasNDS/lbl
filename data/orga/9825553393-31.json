We challenge the current model of economic and corporate globalization, and promote solutions that will help to create environmentally sustainable and socially just societies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We promote environmentally sustainable societies on the local, national, regional and global levels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We seek to increase public participation and democratic decision-making. Greater democracy is both an end in itself and is vital to the protection of the environment and the sound management of natural resources.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We work towards environmental, social, economic and political justice and equal access to resources and opportunities on the local, national, regional and international levels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Friends of the Earth Europe is committed to transparency about EU interest representation. Friends of the Earth Europe believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide full EU lobbying transparency. When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of Friends of the Earth Europe, carry out such activities.","acronym":"FoEE","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Banking and financial services, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Consumers, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Research and innovation, Taxation, Trade, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Trade&#xd;<br />- The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement between the EU and Indonesia&#xd;<br />- The Convention establishing a multilateral court for the settlement of investment disputes (MIC) &#xd;<br />- The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada (CETA) &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Financial regulation&#xd;<br />- The shareholder Rights Directive; (COM/2014/0213 final - 2014/0121 (COD))&#xd;<br />- Capital Markets Union (COM(2015) 468 final)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />UN Treaty and Corporate Accountability &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Fossil Fuels: &#xd;<br />- EIB energy and climate policy and project funding &#xd;<br />- EIB monetary policy&#xd;<br />- EC Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) &#xd;<br />- EC and European Parliament list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI)&#xd;<br />- EC energy and climate policy including gas&#xd;<br />- EC recommendation on use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing (fracking) (2014/70/EU)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />GMOs:&#xd;<br />- Member States restrictions on GMO cultivation (Directive (EU) 2015/412)&#xd;<br />- Reviewing the decision- making process on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) (COM(2015) 176)&#xd;<br />- Reviewing directive 2001/18 on environmental risk assessment&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Biodiversity:&#xd;<br />- EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020&#xd;<br />- Birds Directive (Council Directive 2009/147/EC) &#xd;<br />- Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC)&#xd;<br />- Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC) &#xd;<br />- EU action plan on Biodiversity (COM(2017) 198 final)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Common Agricultural Policy:&#xd;<br />- Direct payments (Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013)&#xd;<br />- Rural development (Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013)&#xd;<br />- Financing and monitoring of the common agricultural policy (Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013) &#xd;<br />- Tackling unfair trading practices in the business-to-business food supply chain (COM(2014) 472 final)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Commission proposal on 'Plant Protein Production Strategy for the EU' &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Climate justice and energy&#xd;<br />- Revision of the Energy Efficiency Directive &#xd;<br />- EU 2030 climate and energy targets &#xd;<br />Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 (procedure 2011/2095(INI))&#xd;<br />- Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RES Directive 2009/28/EC)&#xd;<br />- State Aid guidelines&#xd;<br />- Energy security package&#xd;<br />- Market Design Initiative and Directive&#xd;<br />- Just transition&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Circular Economy:&#xd;<br />- Closing the loop - An EU action plan for the Circular Economy (COM(2015) 614 )&#xd;<br />- Amendment of Waste Directive (COM(2015) 595 final 2015/0275(COD))&#xd;<br />- Amendment of packaging and packaging waste Directive (COM(2015) 596 final 2015/0276(COD))&#xd;<br />- Amendment of the landfill of waste Directive (COM(2015) 594 final 2015/0274(COD))&#xd;<br />- Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (COM(2011) 571) / procedure 2011/1068(INI))&#xd;<br />- Raw material Initiative (COM(2008)699) in November 2008, under Horizon 2020&#xd;<br />- European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy (COM(2018) 28)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda)&#xd;<br />-COM(2016) 739 final  - Next steps for a sustainable European future -  European action for sustainability&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Better regulation &amp; transparency&#xd;<br />- Better regulation package of the European Commission (u.a.
