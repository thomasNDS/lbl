We challenge the current model of economic and corporate globalization, and promote solutions that will help to create environmentally sustainable and socially just societies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We promote environmentally sustainable societies on the local, national, regional and global levels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We seek to increase public participation and democratic decision-making. Greater democracy is both an end in itself and is vital to the protection of the environment and the sound management of natural resources.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We work towards environmental, social, economic and political justice and equal access to resources and opportunities on the local, national, regional and international levels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Friends of the Earth Europe is committed to transparency about EU interest representation. Friends of the Earth Europe believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide full EU lobbying transparency. When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of Friends of the Earth Europe, carry out such activities.","acronym":"FoEE","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Consumers, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Research and innovation, Trade, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Trade:&#xd;<br />- The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement between the EU and Indonesia&#xd;<br />- The Convention establishing a multilateral court for the settlement of investment disputes (MIC) &#xd;<br />- The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada (CETA) &#xd;<br />- EU-Singapore Investment Protection Agreement (EUSIPA) &#xd;<br />- All new negotiations between the EU and US&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />UN Treaty and Corporate Accountability: &#xd;<br />- Accountability of European corporations for human rights and environmental impacts.&#xd;<br />- EU CSR agenda related to HRDD and access to justice for victims of corporate crimes&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Fossil Fuels: &#xd;<br />- EIB energy and climate policy and project funding &#xd;<br />- EIB monetary policy&#xd;<br />- EC Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) &#xd;<br />- EC and European Parliament list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI)&#xd;<br />- EC energy and climate policy including gas&#xd;<br />- EC recommendation on use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing (fracking) (2014/70/EU)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />GMOs:&#xd;<br />- Directive on the release of GMO cultivation (Directive 2001/18)&#xd;<br />- Reviewing the decision-making process on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) (COM(2015) 176)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Biodiversity:&#xd;<br />- EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020&#xd;<br />- Birds Directive (Council Directive 2009/147/EC) &#xd;<br />- Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC)&#xd;<br />- Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC) &#xd;<br />- EU action plan on Biodiversity (COM(2017) 198 final)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Common Agricultural Policy:&#xd;<br />- CAP strategic plans – Proposal for a regulation COM(2018) 392&#xd;<br />- Financing, management and monitoring of the CAP – Proposal for a regulation COM(2018) 393&#xd;<br />- Common organisation of the markets – Proposal for a regulation COM(2018) 394&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Climate justice and energy:&#xd;<br />- Revision of the Energy Efficiency Directive &#xd;<br />- EU 2030 climate and energy targets &#xd;<br />Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 (procedure 2011/2095(INI))&#xd;<br />- Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RES Directive 2009/28/EC)&#xd;<br />- State Aid guidelines&#xd;<br />- Market Design Initiative and Directive&#xd;<br />- Just transition&#xd;<br />- Energy democracy&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Circular Economy:&#xd;<br />- Closing the loop - An EU action plan for the Circular Economy (COM(2015) 614)&#xd;<br />- Waste Directive (Directive (EU) 2018/851 Amending Directive 2008/98/EC)&#xd;<br />- Packaging and packaging waste Directive (Directive (EU) 2018/852 Amending Directive 94/62/EC)&#xd;<br />- Landfill of waste Directive (Directive (EU) 2018/850 amending Directive 1999/31/EC)&#xd;<br />- Proposal for Directive on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment (COM(2018) 340 final, 2018/0172 (COD)) &#xd;<br />- Raw material Initiative (COM(2008)699) in November 2008, under Horizon 2020&#xd;<br />- European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy (COM(2018)28)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda):&#xd;<br />-COM(2016) 739 final - Next steps for a sustainable European future - European action for sustainability&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Better regulation &amp; transparency:&#xd;<br />- Better regulation package of the European Commission (u.a.
