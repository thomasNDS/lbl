This is still essential as governments’ pesticide evaluation lags many years behind product development and Europe’s pesticide approval process has yet to tackle new concerns like endocrine disruption and increased sensitivity among children and foetuses. We have also seen that the latest generation of pesticides sold by chemicals companies are not appreciably safer for the environment or our health. So replacing old pesticides with new won’t do much to reduce risks. PAN Europe therefore stresses that better agricultural practice and management are the best way to ensure sustainability and high food quality.","acronym":"PAN Europe","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Consumers, Environment, Food Safety, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"●\tRegulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market&#xd;<br />●\tDirective 2009/128/EC establishing a framework for sustainable use of pesticides; &#xd;<br />●\tRegulation (EC) No. 1185/2009 concerning statistics on plant protection products; &#xd;<br />●\tRegulation (EC) No. 396/2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed;&#xd;<br />●\tDirective 2000/60/EC establishing a framework for water policy;&#xd;<br />●\tDirective 2009/90/EC on strategies against chemical pollution of surface waters&#xd;<br />●\tDirective 2008/105/EC on environmental quality standards (also known as priority substances directive)&#xd;<br />●\tRegulation (EC) 1305/2013 on Rural Development of the CAP&#xd;<br />●\tRegulation (EC) 1306/2013 on Horizontal issues such as funding and controls of the CAP&#xd;<br />●\tRegulation (EC) 1307/2013 on Direct payments for farmers of the CAP","lastUp":"2019-04-10T09:23:20.887+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
