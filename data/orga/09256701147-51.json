In the construction sector public procurement contracts are a large segment of the available work. It is therefore essential that SMEs have a fair access to public procurement.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />European Sectoral Social Dialogue&#xd;<br />As representative of the craftsmen and SME of the European construction sector EBC is asking to be accepted as a full member in the European Social Dialogue Committee for Construction and contribute with input of its construction companies and craftsmen on important social issues.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Revision of the European Standardisation System and the EU's Construction Products Regulation&#xd;<br />European Standards are increasingly affecting business across the EU.
