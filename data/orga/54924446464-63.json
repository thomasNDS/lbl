It has members from 13 Member States, including fire brigade associations, insurers, fire safety laboratories, consultancies, fire sprinkler manufacturers and installers.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We have been involved in campaigns in a number of Member States as well as in the European Parliament. Our goal is to achieve recognition in fire safety regulations of the benefits of fire sprinklers. Over 4,000 Europeans die in fires each year and the economic impact is over 1% of GDP. Fire is also a major cause of environmental incidents and the leading cause of incidents that affect water quality.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Decades of statistics show that almost all the deaths could be prevented by sprinklers and that over 80% of the economic losses could also be avoided. Sprinklers would also prevent fires from leading to environmental incidents by keeping them small and using much less water to put them out.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />At the same time it is possible to relax other fire safety measures, such as the maximum size of fire compartments, so that the net cost of fitting sprinklers is minimal. In many cases it is cheaper to build with sprinklers than without. Insurers also offer discounts so that there is a clear economic argument in their favour.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Some countries have recognised this in their national fire safety regulations but ignorance is widespread, as is resistance to change, so most countries only require sprinklers in a few types of buildings, such as shopping ccentres, where they have experienced individual fires with massive loss of life. Many countries leave their fire safety regulations unchanged for decades, so that they are now obsolete. A European approach, setting out best practice with current knowledge, would help to bring the Member States up to a common level. It would also mean that those who travel across borders would encounter familiar fire safety measures.","acronym":"EFSN","interests":"Business and Industry, Consumers, Environment, Single market, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Fire Industry Exchange Platform, research on facade fire safety and on the toxicity of smoke released during the combustion of construction products.","lastUp":"2019-12-22T13:00:58.938+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
