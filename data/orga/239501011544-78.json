Since 2002 Terra Humana Ltd. has coordinated multiple international research and development programs in the specific field of carbon refinery and phosphorus recovery. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Terra Humana Ltd is the original source and inventor of “3R” Recycle-Reduce-Reuse zero emission advanced pyrolysis technology, which has been developed specifically for animal by-product processing and Phosphorus recovery and reuse. The 3R development has been solely financed by the company until 2002. From 2002 the European Commission selected the technology and co-funded the further developments through its research and development programmes (FP5, FP6, FP7, CIP-ECOINNOVATION, H2020). The 2002-2018 S&amp;T RTD progressive evolution resulted, that by 2018 the company reached high research maturity and targeting industrialization of Phosphorus recovery under Circular Economy incentives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />During the past decades Terra Humana has built up a phosphorus recovery specialized knowledge base and a wide network of P specific stakeholders in ten EU MS both in the scientific and industrial sectors well. &#xd;<br />The owner and managing director of the company is Mr. Edward Someus, a Swedish-Hungarian senior environmental engineer and businessman with core competence and specialization on industrial pyrolysis, carbon product development, phosphorus recovery from animal by-products and marketing of such products in the agricultural and environmental industrial sectors as adsorbent. Mr. Someus is also involved in European Commission standardization and harmonization of law as a consultant for Circular Economy and revision of the EU Fertilisers Regulation in the area of expanding to the innovative recovered fertilisers.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The flagship project of the company is recovering phosphorus and other nutrients from agricultural and food industrial by-product streams by pyrolysis technology with interlinked advance biotechnological and other advanced formulations. Terra Humana Ltd. is the only one biochar vendor in Europe, with official and accredited Authority permit under the united EU and Member State regulation to use qualified and eco-safe biochar product in open ecological soil environment (permit number 04.2/102-2/2015). Recently the company also received Authority permit for organic phosphorus recovery plant full industrial installation and operation under EU regulations (FES/01/0851-33/2015 that is uniting permits from ten different Authorities).&#xd;<br />During the past two decades the company put in huge human and financial efforts to develop innovative eco-industrial advanced solutions, design, implement and tests “product like” field plants to meet SME specific market demands in the EU 27, USA, Canada, Australia and Japan. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Extensive scientific and SME industrial networks developed in 10 EU countries with large number of RTD partners, Universities, large institutions, SME and large industrial organizations. The SME RTD Company having advanced and well equipped research, laboratory and field test facilities specialized on P recovery in W Hungary with 12 high qualified work force and extensive SME cooperation on international level. Large industrial scale P recovery bio-phosphate projects are under preparation.","acronym":"TERRA","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Development, Education, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, Internal Market, Regional Policy, Research and Technology","euInitiatives":"HIGH AGRONOMIC EFFICIENT PHOSPHORUS RECOVERY:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ABC (Animal Bone Char) action is targeting to recover P and other plant nutrients from animal by-products (bone) in economical industrial scale which is clearly linked to the sustainable food production. The commercial implementation of ABC innovation is linked to EU policy objectives: &#xd;<br />The revision of EC 2003/2003 identified as one of the key legislative proposal under the Circular Economy action plan. The Commission has adopted a proposal for a revised Fertiliser Regulation (COM (2016)157 for laying down rules on the making available on the market of CE marked fertilising products. This facilitate recognition of recovered organic fertilisers (like ABC) in the single market at thus support the role of the bio-nutrients in the Circular Economy. The Raw Material Initiative – COM (2008)699 is highlighting that the”Securing reliable and undistorted access to raw materials is increasingly becoming an important factor for the EU’s competitiveness and, hence, crucial to the success of the Lisbon Partnership for growth and jobs”. The EC has created a list of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs), where CRMs combine a high economic importance to the EU with a high risk associated with their supply. The phosphate rocks are listed on the CRMs list (COM (2014) 297 final) and Phosphorus is at the centre of Commission's actions to improve its sustainable use. Phosphate rock CRM is crucial to Europe’s security of food supply, economy and essential to maintaining and improving our quality of life and \"there is a high supply risk due to concentrated production from three main countries, though it is close to the supply risk threshold. Corporate concentration for this material appears relatively high compared to other materials, rising over the past five years. The economic importance is moderately high, exceeding the criticality threshold. There is no recycled input and substitution is impossible in its main application as an input to fertilisers and other chemicals.\" (Report on critical raw materials for the EU, May 2014, DG ENTR). ABC is recovered phosphorus is a renewable fertilizer source that can substitute the increasingly scare mineral phosphates.&#xd;<br />The Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe – COM (2011) 571 – is setting up a milestone by 2020 that “incentives to healthier and more sustainable food production and consumption will be widespread and will have driven a 20% reduction in the food chain's resource inputs”. &#xd;<br />Consultative Communication on the Sustainable Use of Phosphorus – COM (2013) 517 - states that “greater recycling and use of organic phosphorus where it is needed could stabilise the amounts of mined phosphate required and mitigate the soil contamination and water pollution issues. This will then put us on track to close the phosphorus cycle in the long term, when the physical limitations of the resource will become increasingly important.” Estimates suggest that through resource efficiency, global fertilizer phosphorus use from primary sources can be reduced by 18%, compared to currently envisaged policies (COM (2011) 571 final).&#xd;<br />By recycling and recovery of phosphorus from animal by-products and closing phosphorus cycle the ABC proposal is contributing to the implementation of EU “circular economy package” for turning Europe into more circular economy and boosting recycling and preventing the loss of valuable products and move us towards zero-waste. Towards a circular economy: A zero waste programme for Europe – COM (2014)398 - is targeting to reduce food waste generation by 30% by 2025. The by-products from food production (P is mainly concentrated at bones) could recycle significant quantities of P, if properly managed.","lastUp":"2018-03-10T09:55:02.831+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
