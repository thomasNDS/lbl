A melting pot of different legal traditions, it develops and services multilateral legal instruments, which respond to global needs.&#xd;<br />An increasing number of non-Member States are also becoming Parties to the Hague Conventions. As a result, the work of the Conference encompasses 150 countries around the world.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The statutory mission of the Conference is to work for the \"progressive unification\" of these rules. This involves finding internationally-agreed approaches to issues such as jurisdiction of the courts, applicable law, and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in a wide range of areas, from commercial law and banking law to international civil procedure and from child protection to matters of marriage and personal status.&#xd;<br />The ultimate goal of the Organisation is to work for a world in which, despite the differences between legal systems, persons - individuals as well as companies - can enjoy a high degree of legal security.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />With the aim of harmonising the implementation of the Conventions, the Secretariat organises, assists in organising and participates in conferences and seminars held at international, regional and national levels to educate the various persons involved in the implementation of the Conventions, including judges, Central Authority personnel and members of the legal profession. A judicial newsletter on international child protection is also published. The Permanent Bureau is regularly visited by groups of interested persons such as parliamentarians and students. An increasing number of interns, as well as civil servants seconded by their Governments, spend time working within the Secretariat. Members of the Permanent Bureau regularly publish articles in learned journals and contribute to books and other publications.&#xd;<br />The Permanent Bureau publishes and maintains a Collection of Conventions, as well as a full suite of publications, including Practical Handbooks on the operation of certain Hague Conventions as well as Guides to Good Practice and other useful publications. It also edits the Proceedings of each of the Sessions which now encompasses an impressive collection of \"Actes et Documents\".&#xd;<br />The Conference website, www.hcch.net, presents general information concerning the Hague Conference as well as detailed and updated information on the Hague Conventions: texts of the Conventions, full status reports, bibliographies, information regarding the authorities designated under the Conventions on judicial and administrative co-operation, explanatory reports, etc.","acronym":"HCCH","interests":"Consumers, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights","euInitiatives":"iSupport  Project – (electronic case management and secure communication system for the 2007 Child Support Convention).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />European Council Working Party on e-Law (e-Justice) – Expert group on videoconferencing.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Implementation of the electronic Apostille Program (e-APP) (which previously incorporated the “e-APP For Europe Project” in 2011 funded by the EU)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Policy work on the treatment of international surrogacy","lastUp":"2020-01-09T10:49:55.788+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
