As one of the stakeholders, EUCROF is interested in promoting and supporting high-quality clinical trials by observing internationally agreed ethical, technical and scientific principles. EUCROF organises and supports training and education programmes to increase the quality of clinical research and to improve collaboration and interaction amongst all stakeholders in the field in Europe. Active participation in international congresses and meetings further underlines the significant role of CROs in Clinical Research in Europe.&#xd;<br />Regulatory Authorities recognize EUCROF as the representative for European-based CROs, regularly calling upon EUCROF to contribute to the continuous debate on the improvement of rules and regulations.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The aims and objectives of EUCROF are defined as follows:&#xd;<br />•\tPromote clinical research of high quality in Europe in general and in the European Union in particular;&#xd;<br />•\tPlay the role of advocacy to represent the interests of CROs in Europe, directly interacting with regulatory bodies, EU Commission and Parliament, pharmaceutical-biotechnology industry, patients associations, academia and medical research community;&#xd;<br />•\tPromote a close relationship and mutual understanding and respect between the national member associations and the above-mentioned bodies;&#xd;<br />•\tPromote the exchange of information between member associations;&#xd;<br />•\tDevelop training and educational programmes on clinical research, and assist the national member associations in setting up such programmes and ensuring their quality;&#xd;<br />•\tDistribute information on developments in clinical research to health professionals;&#xd;<br />•\tOrganise international conferences and meetings.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Furthermore, the Federation's objectives include: discussions on selected topics with representatives of the pharmaceutical industry e.g.  to enhance business relations and to identify common concerns, support more productive discussions with European bodies (EMEA/EU Commission), and endeavour to develop transcontinental relationships with other associations e.g. with ACRO in the USA and JCROA in Japan.&#xd;<br />At present, the Federation consists of members from 11 Europe countries: Czech Republic (ACRO-CZ), the Netherlands (ACRON), Spain (AECIC), France (AFCROs), Italy (AICRO), Belgium (BeCRO), Germany (BVMA), UK (CCRA), Greece (HACRO), Slovakia (SACROP) and Turkey (SAKDER). The Federation has also 13 associate members in Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and Ukraine. It stands for over 350 member CROs and over 25,000 employees.&#xd;<br />Since December 2005, the Federation is managed by an Executive Board which holds monthly meetings. Each year, the Federation organizes two General Assemblies. Furthermore, EUCROF promotes the quality in clinical research by organizing EUCROF Conferences which provide an excellent platform for discussing current topics in an international setting.","acronym":"EUCROF","interests":"Business and Industry, Education and training, Public Health, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"During the last year, EUCROF has performed many activities as stakeholder, invited to represent the Contract Research Organisations point of view on many Clinical Research issues, new rules and regulations during formal meetings with the European Medicinal Agency (EMA), Paediatric Research Consortia, Patient Associations and Conferences on Clinical Research:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-EMA: EU clinical trials portal and Union database: meeting with stakeholders, London &#xd;<br />-EMA: Participation to UAT for EU Portal&#xd;<br />- GCP Inspectors WG and interested parties Joint Meeting&#xd;<br />-Enpr-EMA meetings &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EUCROF has created 12 active working groups:&#xd;<br />1.\tClinical Trials Legislation&#xd;<br />2.\tCommunication&#xd;<br />3.\tEarly Phase&#xd;<br />4.\tEvents and Training&#xd;<br />5.\tInnovative Medicines&#xd;<br />6.\tLate Phase&#xd;<br />7.\tMedical Devices&#xd;<br />8.\tNew Technologies&#xd;<br />9.\tOutsourcing Management&#xd;<br />10.\tPaediatrics&#xd;<br />11.
