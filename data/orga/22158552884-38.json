JEF is independent from all political parties and ideologies and pursues its objectives autonomously. Even though JEF will not identify with any of them, the organisation can participate in the exchange of opinions and experiences with other political movements, European, national and local institutions and associations, as well as the general public. JEF is not interested in the direct management of political power. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AIMS&#xd;<br />JEF aims at developing a better understanding of European Federalism and advancing the implementation of the federal ideals. JEF concentrates its action on the achievement of international democracy through respect for federal principles in Europe and beyond. JEF seeks to spread the idea of European Federalism which can be generally described as the attachment to a complex and balanced system of supranational governance that tries to guarantee the highest standards of democracy and transparency, combined with effective decision-making bodies which deliver at the appropriate level tangible solutions to societal problems. In short, a healthy mix between democracy and efficiency is thus central to Federalist philosophy. JEF communicates European Federalism as a message of European brotherhood that rests on the following five pillars: (1) democracy and participation, (2) subsidiarity, (3) autonomy and division of competences, (4) peace, the rule of law and human rights and (5) unity in diversity. JEF thus campaigns for a new European Union that is able to rise to the cross-border challenges of our interconnected societies. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />TOOLS&#xd;<br />JEF aims to spread its ideas by the following means:&#xd;<br />i)The coordination of its local, regional, national and European bodies and the inclusion of its members in the work of the association;&#xd;<br />ii)The development of the contacts and exchanges between European youth;&#xd;<br />iii)The regular organisation of campaigns, projects, study-seminars, trainings and educational courses in the field of European affairs;&#xd;<br />iv)The issuance of press releases and the publication of magazines, on-line or in paper version, in order to voice the opinion of the European youth;&#xd;<br />v)The organisation of meetings, activities and street actions to raise awareness of European affairs among the general public;&#xd;<br />vi)The advocacy of its objectives towards both public and private organisations.","acronym":"JEF","interests":"Borders and Security, Budget, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Taxation, Trade, Youth","euInitiatives":"The main policies followed by our organisations are the ones of free movement and youth mobility, particularly in the LIBE Committee.
