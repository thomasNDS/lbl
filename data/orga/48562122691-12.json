Several research centres are also part of our partnership. We work on public health and social equity policy, practice, and research. We also explore and strengthen the links between them. Our approach focuses on health in all policies, reducing health inequalities gaps and gradients, working on determinants across the life course, and sustainability. Today, the EuroHealthNet partnership includes 61 members, associate members, and observers, coming from 24 EU Member States. They steer the work of the Brussels office through three collaborating platforms: Practice, Policy, and Research. A core team works to unite and amplify the platformsâ€™ work. The partnership is governed by the General Council, which comprises all partners, and the Executive Board.","acronym":"","interests":"Budget, Climate Action, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Food Safety, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"EU 2020 Strategy; European Pillar of Social Rights; EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation; EU Health Programme; EU Action Plan on Childhood Obesity; EU Sustainable Development Strategy; European Structural and Investment Funds; Multi-annual Financial Framework; Health Inequalities; European Semester; Alliance for Investing in Children; Covenant on Demographic Change; EU Occupational Safety and Health Administration healthy workplaces campaign; 2030 climate &amp; energy framework; Economics of Wellbeing; High-Level Taskforce on Social Infrastructure Investment; EU Green Deal; EU Beating cancer Plan; Digital Health; Future of Work; Annual Convention for Inclusive Growth; Research &amp; Innovation","lastUp":"2020-01-06T15:11:47.745+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
