We do that by supporting projects and policy development together with our members and the EU institutions; by exchanging information and by communication in and beyond our network. \t&#xd;<br />EuroHealthNet has existed since 1996, when a smaller group of national health promotion agencies came together with the assistance of the European Commission to work together at EU level. In 2003 the growing body became an autonomous entity with a legal statute in Belgium.&#xd;<br />Nowadays, EuroHealthNet counts over 40 members and associate members in 30 European countries, thereby constituting a valuable platform for information, advice, policy and advocacy on health and equity issues at EU level.   &#xd;<br />EuroHealthNet does not seek financial gain from its work and as such receives funding from a range of sources and donors only to carry out its objectives.","acronym":"","interests":"Climate Action, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Food Safety, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"EU 2020 Strategy; European Pillar of Social Rights; EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation; EU Health Programme; EU Action Plan on Childhood Obesity; EU Sustainable Development Strategy","lastUp":"2018-05-04T11:29:06.959+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"700000-799999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
