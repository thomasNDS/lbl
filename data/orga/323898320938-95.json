The Missions outsource their administrative support services in the Visa application cycle to CKGS to focus their efforts on their core tasks. Outsourcing of such services also takes away the security, and general manpower constraints that a mission would need to take on, inorder to process Tourist or business Visa applications for persons wishing to travel to the European country. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Updates and future developments on the Visa code directly impact the nature of our operational processes. The introduction to the European commission will assist us in preparing for any changes that are planned, that might impact the operational processes in place at our Visa Application centres.","lastUp":"2017-02-21T06:20:35.604+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
