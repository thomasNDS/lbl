Its member organisations have an interest in the development of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS Standards) and how they contribute to the efficiency of capital markets. Furthermore, EFRAG aims at stimulation of innovation in the field of corporate reporting in Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EFRAG’s mission is to serve the European public interest by developing and promoting European views in the field of financial reporting and ensuring these views are properly considered in the IASB standard-setting process and in related international debates. EFRAG ultimately provides advice to the European Commission on whether newly issued or revised IFRS Standards meet the criteria in the IAS Regulation for endorsement for use in the EU, including whether endorsement would be conducive to the European public good. EFRAG stimulates innovation in corporate reporting through the European Corporate Reporting Lab@EFRAG's work in sharing good practices, which also complements and contributes to our work on financial reporting.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EFRAG seeks input from all stakeholders, and obtains evidence about specific European circumstances, throughout the standard-setting process and in providing our endorsement advice. Our legitimacy is built on transparency, governance, due process (which may include field tests, impact analyses and outreaches), public accountability and thought leadership. This enables EFRAG to speak convincingly, clearly and consistently, and be recognised as the European Voice in financial reporting.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EFRAG is achieving its mission both through its participation in the IASB consultation process and its proactive work, and, under the leadership of the European Commission, its interaction with the Accounting Regulatory Committee, to hear about the potential economic or political concerns from Member States’ representatives. Upon request, EFRAG also provides the European Commission with technical expertise and advice on whether newly published IFRS meet the criteria for endorsement in the European Union, in conformity with the 1606-2002 “IAS Regulation”. EFRAG provides reports on good practices and innovations in corporate reporting.","acronym":"EFRAG","interests":"Banking and financial services, Business and Industry, Economy, finance and the euro, Single market","euInitiatives":"EFRAG provides European input into the development of IFRS Standards issued by the IASB and provides the European Commission with technical expertise and advice on accounting matters and corporate reporting.
