These bodies fight corruption in the national arena in a number of ways. TI’s global network of chapters and contacts also use advocacy campaigns to lobby governments to implement anti-corruption reforms.&#xd;\nTransparency International as a global movement works with a large number of other actors on specific aspects – national governments, international organisations, civil society, media, the private sector and individual citizens.&#xd;\nTransparency International is part of the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) Civil Society Coalition (www.uncaccoalition.org). It also is a member of the Financial Transparency Coalition and together we work on anti-money-laundering and country-by-country reporting (www.financialtransparency.org). Transparency International EU is also a member of Finance Watch (www.finance-watch.org).","memberOrga":"Transparency International consists of more than 100 chapters – locally established, independent organisations – that fight corruption in their respective countries. 24 of these national chapters are located in EU member states (with the exceptions of Malta, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Croatia).

It brings people together in a powerful worldwide coalition to end the devastating impact of corruption on men, women and children around the world.&#xd;<br />Our vision is a world in which government, politics, business, civil society and the daily lives of people are free of corruption.&#xd;<br />Since its founding in 1993, TI has played a lead role in improving the lives of millions around the world by building momentum for the anti-corruption movement. TI raises awareness and diminishes apathy and tolerance of corruption, and devises and implements practical actions to address it.&#xd;<br />Transparency International is a global, politically non-partisan network including more than 100 locally established national chapters and chapters-in-formation. These bodies fight corruption in the national arena in a number of ways. They bring together relevant players from government, civil society, business and the media to promote transparency in elections, in public administration, in procurement and in business. TI’s global network of chapters and contacts also use advocacy campaigns to influence governments to implement anti-corruption reforms.&#xd;<br />In addition to the national chapters, Transparency International has an International Secretariat (TI-S) in Berlin. The International Secretariat is an independent association (“eingetragener Verein”) established under German law. The secretariat provides leadership for the movement’s international initiatives, supports chapters and coordinates our regional work through knowledge sharing, advocacy and coalition building.&#xd;<br />In collaboration with national chapters, the secretariat produces numerous research, tools and policy positions. It serves as a knowledge centre, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of corruption and new approaches to tackling it.&#xd;<br />Transparency International’s relations with the EU Institutions are coordinated by Transparency International EU (the Brussels office of the organisation). TI-EU is an independent AISBL established under Belgian law. It is the mission of TI EU to prevent corruption and promote integrity, transparency and accountability in EU institutions, policies and legislation. It is its objective to create lasting, structural change at the EU level so that government, politics, business, civil society and the daily lives of people are characterized by integrity, justice and security.&#xd;<br />TI EU works in close cooperation with the TI Secretariat in Berlin and TI national chapters particularly with those 24 chapters located in EU member states. The objective of TI EU is to fulfill the European dimension of the global TI movement – to provide Brussels-based advocacy at the EU level. &#xd;<br />By its very nature, corruption is a crosscutting issue that negatively affects citizens. The many facets of corruption exacerbate the exploitation of the poor and underprivileged, and can have serious implications on the right to equality before law, the right to property, the freedom to perform business, fair and just working conditions, fair political representation and participation, and the basic rights to dignity, integrity and personal security. To alleviate these problems, TI EU works to fight corruption and to create an EU in which all citizens can exercise their fundamental rights in full.&#xd;<br />In addition to that, EU legislation and policies can have significant impact on the fight against corruption at national level in EU member states and beyond. The work at EU level thus contributes to the fight against corruption in many countries around the world, for example through work on anti-money laundering regulation, development aid, structural funds and by ensuring that the EU Institutions themselves lead by example when it comes to transparency and the prevention of corruption.","acronym":"TI","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Single market, Sport, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"Transparency International EU aims to prevent corruption and promote integrity, transparency and accountability in EU institutions policies and legislation.
