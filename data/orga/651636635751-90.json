We mechanically treat these natural plant fibres without chemical cellulose extraction or bleaching. That way we are able to forego binding agents or glue and create stable high quality products without any additives. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our aim is to decentralize production and use local agricultural by-products for local product demand. We are currently producing near Bangalore, India for the Indian market and hope to enter the german market with local production in 2020.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Consumers, Culture and media, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Research and innovation, Trade","euInitiatives":"We are in the process of implementing the BSCI Business Social Compliance Initiative","lastUp":"2019-09-03T17:29:55.186+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
