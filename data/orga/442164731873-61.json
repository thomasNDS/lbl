As highlighted in the Roadmap for this initiative, “Higher education could do more to tackle social divisions”. Aside from its role in innovation and high-skills, higher education has an important role as a model of what individuals can achieve. As such it must make sure everyone has an equal opportunity to participate in higher education and contribute to society to the best of their abilities. The more systematic inclusion in teachers’ curriculum of modules on inclusion would be a first step in ensuring a broader social inclusion in higher education.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-Migration and Integration in Societies","lastUp":"2018-06-23T22:29:47.438+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
