Through its wide network, it aims to combat racist discrimination and social exclusion of Roma through awareness raising, lobbying and policy development. Since its creation, ERIO has been actively involved in shaping European policies for Roma inclusion. In 2005, ERIO with other partners such as ERRC, OSI, MPC and IRCHR, proposed to EU institutions to adopt a Framework Strategy for Roma.  ERIO is among key stakeholders being regularly consulted by the European Commission when addressing Roma-related issues. In light of recent main EU policy developments (i.e. EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies and Council Recommendation), ERIO has become all the more a strategic partner for the EU institutions in assuring the monitoring of their implementation and in advising for further improvement.","acronym":"ERIO","interests":"Culture, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Enlargement, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Youth","euInitiatives":"EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020, Council recommendation on effective Roma integration measures in the member states, Council Conclusions on Accelerating the Process of Roma Integration, Racial Equality Directive 2000/43/EC, Employment Equality Framework Directive 2000/78/EC, Free Movement Directive 2004/38/EC, Framework Decision on racism and xenophobia 2008/913/JHA, the Victims Rights Directive 2012/29/EU, the European 2020 Strategy and the Diversity Charters.","lastUp":"2019-04-06T23:40:31.519+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
