Its interdisciplinary research is conducted in a spirit of total academic freedom. Drawing on the expertise of its own research fellows, as well as that of external specialists, both Belgian and foreign, it provides analysis and policy options that are meant to be as operational as possible.&#xd;<br />Along with research and meetings, the Institute has also developed specialised training activities, both in Brussels and abroad. It can, on request, offer specific programmes for visiting and resident diplomats and foreign professionals. Close cooperation with other research centres, both in Belgium, in Europe and beyond, has resulted in a growing number of joint conferences and in more structured cooperations on research and publications. This has proved to be mutually beneficial and enriching.","acronym":"Egmont","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment, European Neighbourhood Policy, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"External relations and global governance.
