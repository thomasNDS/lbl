The effects on global ocean and air currents and the declining nutrient content of crops for world food are certainty, but every person has an active and passive opportunity to contribute by preventing the progress of climate change.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />H)\tThe entire natural resources are the basis of all operating and economic activities.
