To that end, they should: &#xd;<br />•\tbe ambitious in their goals for real liberalisation,&#xd;<br />•\tachieve a broad and deep coverage of services sectors in WTO members and acceding countries, as well as in regional and bilateral trading partners involved in trade negotiations,&#xd;<br />•\tobtain the widest possible standstill commitments starting at the beginning of each new negotiations, &#xd;<br />•\tgo well beyond these standstills, in order to remove or reduce as far as possible barriers to trade and investment in all services sectors.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Remaining impediments to substantially full market access and national treatment should be liberalised progressively on an agreed transition schedule.  Particular attention should be paid to those services where, not enough progress has been made since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round signed in Marrakech in 1994.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />5.\tThe cross-border delivery of services in electronic form is of growing importance for many services sectors. Therefore, specific attention needs to be paid in the international trade in services negotiations to improving commitments which facilitate that mode of supply for all services sectors.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />6.\tInternational trade in services negotiations should achieve greater liberalisation in all four modes of supply of services: cross-border supply, consumption abroad, commercial presence and presence of natural persons.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />7.\tClose monitoring of countries' ratification and implementation at all relevant part of trade agreements should be conducted.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />8.\tCountries acceding to the WTO must make strong and comprehensive commitments to services liberalisation as part of their accession process.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />9.\tAmong the goals which should be reflected in the commitments made in national schedules the following are of major importance:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />a)\tThe right to establish and operate competitively;&#xd;<br />b)\tForeign investors should have the same access to domestic markets as domestic companies;&#xd;<br />c)\tFreedom to provide cross-border services in highly international-oriented sectors;&#xd;<br />d)\tRemoval of barriers (nationality, residence requirements, etc.) to the posting of key personnel;&#xd;<br />e)\tExceptions to commitments should be precise, transparent, temporary and limited to the minimum required for their purpose;&#xd;<br />f)\tExisting investments should be grandfathered;&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />10.\tPro-competitive principles to rule-making should be developed, while preserving appropriate regulatory frameworks. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />11.\tPolitical and public support for trade liberalisation in services sectors will require greater understanding of the benefits of trade liberalisation and the negotiating processes by which liberalisation is achieved.","acronym":"ESF","interests":"Banking and financial services, Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Migration and asylum, Single market, Trade, Transport","euInitiatives":"European Commission Annual Work Programme and Roadmaps4&#xd;<br />European Commission Impact Assessment webpage5&#xd;<br />European Commission Green Deal impact on Trade Policy,&#xd;<br />European Parliament Legislative Observatory6&#xd;<br />EUR-Lex database7&#xd;<br />Work in Progress document - by Parliamentary committees8&#xd;<br />Trade negotiations with Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Chile, Tunisia, ASEAN, Possible EU-UK Future Relationship, etc.&#xd;<br />Follow up of ratification process of FTA with Mercosur,  Revision of FTA with Mexico,  &#xd;<br />WTO Joint Statement Initiatives on Services Domestic Regulation; E-Commerce; Investment Facilitation, etc.","lastUp":"2019-12-12T11:12:03.130+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
