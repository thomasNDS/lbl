From undercover investigations, to high level lobby meetings, we aim to engage on every level where we might make a difference and bring about change.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our work has revealed how, rather than benefiting a country’s citizens, abundant timber, diamonds, minerals, oil and other natural resources can incentivise corruption, destabilise governments, and lead to war. Through our investigations, advocacy and campaigning, we seek solutions to the ‘resource curse’ so that citizens of resource-rich countries can get a fair share of their country’s wealth.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our works falls into three broad strands:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Corruption&#xd;<br />Corruption blights millions of lives by diverting vast sums of money earned from a country’s natural resources away from its rightful owners – the citizens of that country. Global Witness campaigns to prevent companies, governments and the international financial system from facilitating corruption on a grand scale.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Resources &amp; conflict&#xd;<br />Global Witness campaigns to break the links between natural resources, armed conflict, and human rights abuses.  Our work now covers a range of countries that are affected by or are emerging from violent instability.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Environmental governance&#xd;<br />Forests and land are the planet’s finite resources.  Yet 80% of the world’s tropical forests have been depleted or entirely destroyed and a quarter of the planet’s land has been degraded by deforestation, over-exploitation, industrial activities, and over-grazing.  As demand for resources increases and the planet’s population continues to grow, it is vital that that we take better care of what we have got.","acronym":"","interests":"Budget, Climate Action, Development, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union , Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Humanitarian Aid, Internal Market, Trade","euInitiatives":"EU Action Plan on Sustainable Finance&#xd;<br />EU Responsible Mineral Sourcing Regulation&#xd;<br />EU Accounting and Transparency Directives&#xd;<br />EU Timber Regulation&#xd;<br />FLEGT Action Plan","lastUp":"2018-04-20T10:21:17.610+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
