We do this through: (i) workshops, (ii) round tables, (iii) research, (iv) networking space, (v) internet platform and (vi) conferences (including annual organizing of the New Education Forum).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our activities are dedicated to schools (especially teachers as mentors), employers, goernment run employment agencies, social care, decision makers, research and higher education institutions and organisations engaged in education projects from around the World.&#xd;<br />Center for Innovative Education supports implementing global education and learning of soft skills like cooperation and communication capabilities, self-organization and responsibility for the teamwork at early stages of learning. Through such training young people are more aware of their social roles and are better prepared for entering the labor market and constitute preferable future employees. Taking to the account European Union’s high rate of youth unemployment this issue constitutes a crucial task to address. We strongly believe that solution to this problem lies with restructuring of education, which can be done through dedicated teachers and outside support of business and non-governmental organizations.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Innovative approach of the Center derives from nine years experience of collaboration with over 3.500 schools around Poland and abroad and patented education programs involving entrepreneurs and non-governmental organizations, which result in improving effectiveness of learning (i.e. teacher oriented “MENTOR” programs and students oriented  “TALENT” programs).","acronym":"CIE","interests":"Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Youth","euInitiatives":"Improving Vocational Learning system across member states&#xd;<br />Counteracting youth unemployment&#xd;<br />Reforming formal education&#xd;<br />Encouraging business and non governmental organizations to participate in the education process&#xd;<br />Advocating for implementation of innovative practices in all levels of education&#xd;<br />Extention of Outdoor Learning practices","lastUp":"2019-04-04T11:31:12.130+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
