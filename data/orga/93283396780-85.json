Over time, it gained more independence, and in 1979 turned itself into an international not-for-profit voluntary organization with the name Confederation of Family Organisations in the European Community, and now the European Union. In June 2016, the General Assembly agreed on a new name: COFACE Families Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />COFACE – FAMILIES EUROPE is a network promoting the well-being, health and security of families and their members in a changing society and serves as a trusted entity for family mainstreaming and for the voice/needs of families in the EU and beyond&#xd;<br />We achieve this through coordination between the COFACE Member organisations to assess the needs of families at grass-roots levels, to gather evidence and project trends, and to link these needs to the appropriate policy mechanisms at EU level, such as the European Semester process, the Social Open Method of Coordination, the European Structural and Investment Funds, the European Pillar of Social Rights, as well as other key EU legislative and non-legislative initiatives beyond social and employment policy (gender equality, migration, education, consumer policy, financial services, safer internet and more).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We do this by liaising directly with key EU policy makers in European Parliament, Commission and Council, as well as EU advisory bodies like the European Economic and Social Committee and the EU Committee of the Regions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />It is also our role to drive innovation by facilitating transnational exchanges and foster mutual learning on effective policies and practices between COFACE member organisations, aiming to support national and sub-national policies in the interest of families. COFACE achieves this through the organisation of seminars, ad-hoc expert groups, EU presidency and other conferences, advocacy and awareness raising campaigns, on-line and social communication and dissemination.","acronym":"COFACE","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Borders and Security, Budget, Climate Action, Consumers, Culture, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Single market, Sport, Taxation, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"Work-life balance, Gender equality, Transnational families, Family reunification, Education, ECEC, Inclusive education, Disability, UN CRPD, Deinstitutionalisation, Family carers, Digitalisation, Online safety, Financial inclusion, Health, Family policy, EU Pillar of Social Rights.","lastUp":"2019-09-02T11:02:07.213+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
