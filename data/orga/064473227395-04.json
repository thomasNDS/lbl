ERYICA’s role is to foster co-operation in the field of youth information work and services; to develop, support and promote quality general youth information policy and practice at all levels; and to ensure that the information needs of young people and the principles of the European Youth Information Charter are respected.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Youth information and counselling services provide high quality guidance to young people and help them make informed decisions to lead their lives constructively. The main goal of these services is to promote young people's active citizenship, to support their access to rights, and to enhance their autonomy and active participation in society.","acronym":"ERYICA","interests":"Communication, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, External Relations, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Sport, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"ERYICA is currently following the EU Youth Strategy, the Erasmus+ Programme, the Youth Guarantee, Structured Dialogue, the priorities of EU Presidencies, the EU Employment Strategy, Public Health Europe- any initiative that concerns young people throughout Europe. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ERYICA currently receives an Erasmus+ operating grant of approximately 50 000 €/year, in the framework of Civil Society Cooperation in the Field of Youth. This is an opportunity for ERYICA to raise stakeholder awareness of the European policy agenda in the field of youth and boost stakeholder participation in the field of youth. In the activities of our members, promotion of the Erasmus+ Programme, the Youth Guarantee, the EU Youth Strategy and the priorities of EU Presidencies are frequently cited targets. This is complemented by their participation in the Structured Dialogue process.&#xd;<br />Other major targets include the mainstreaming of European youth policies and bridging their content to member countries, so that they are put into practice for the benefit of young people. While our members have the professional competences to deliver this task, the high number of their activities, the up-to-date topics and delivery methods, as well as their national structures, assist them in this venture.&#xd;<br />ERYICA is involved in and coordinates different Erasmus+ projects  (e.g the current Erasmus+ project DOYIT below). These typically promote the professionalism of youth information workers or develop new tools. A number of training courses are organised by ERYICA each year.&#xd;<br />ERYICA works in collaboration with the Partnership of the European Commission and the Council of Europe in the Field of Youth (EU-CoE Youth Partnership) and is a member of the European Platform on Learning Mobility (EPLM), which aims to create a participatory space for exchange and cooperation between practitioners, researchers and policy makers. The Agency also participates in its Steering Group meetings and biannual conferences.&#xd;<br />ERYICA has a training system that aims to support and promote quality generalist youth information and it was developed with the needs of our diverse network in mind. The system is continuously broadening, and existing modules are constantly being revised, keeping an eye on new trends of the youth information field (see the DOYIT project below) and the different situations in member countries. Training courses have been designed and revised by ERYICA’s Training Task Force (TTF), gathering some of the most recognised trainers and training experts in Europe in the field of youth information work. ERYICA currently offers 6 training courses, which can be found on our website: http://eryica.org/page/training-system.  &#xd;<br />Every two years, ERYICA publishes a guide of good practices amongst its members, entitled “SHEryica - Good Practice in Youth Information”. It is filled with success stories from our network and it seeks to inspire the creation of new, innovative projects, while giving recognition to the achievements displayed. The latest edition was published in the end of 2016.","lastUp":"2018-09-27T11:10:07.168+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
