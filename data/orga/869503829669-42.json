The combined strength of all stakeholders can multiply the development resources and options for bringing projects to fruition many times.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tBudapest as a home (I) is appealing if a healthy and attractive environment where personal ambitions are widely achievable can be created for the people living here. To this end, accessible services that operate properly and the targeted development of the built environment are required.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tCreating such a built environment is a cornerstone of community life (II) as well because public spaces provide the venue for meeting and common experiences. Rankings of the liveability of cities usually also measure this, viewing cities as centres of creativity, entertainment, sustainable economy and environmental development.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tThe role of the location of any undertaking is vital to its success because of the available skills of the labour force, the regulation of the economy or the infrastructure and services present. Budapest as a place to work (III) will develop in the right direction if the city allows companies to thrive and exploits the values they create and their expertise.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tThe city as a system (IV) will be based on the cooperation of an increasing number of participants in the future. For this, in addition to the effective operation of the local authorities and transforming their participation in developments, there is a need for stakeholders outside the local authorities to understand and see the functioning of the city in a transparent way as well as the global consequences of certain decisions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tJust as the realisation of the Urban Development Concept requires a broad partnership, the development of the city cannot stop at its administrative boundaries either. Thus Budapest needs to develop regional, national and international cooperation (V) which strengthens its position and promotes the optimal regional division of resources and tasks.\"&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Brussels Representation of the Municipality works along the above goals and principles, collects and forwards information about the different EU policies, initiatives, supports the city in formulating and forwarding opinions, positions to the relevant EU stakeholders, institutions. Partnerships are built through networking and attending (also organising) seminars, conferences and other events.","acronym":"","interests":"Climate Action, Culture, Digital economy and society, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Sport, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"The Brussels Representation follows all EU policies and initiatives that are relevant to the City.
