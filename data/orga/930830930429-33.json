We deliver digital equality by securing policy change through partnerships and coalitions. We believe in the power of working together, so we work with a wide range of actors from governments, businesses, and civil society to understand the issues, advocate, and collaborate to deliver change.&#xd;<br />We also advocate based on evidence. Our work is evidence-based, meaning that our conversations with policy makers — and our related advocacy campaigns — are rooted in robust research, often our own.&#xd;<br />Finally, we experiment and innovate. What works in one country or city won’t necessarily work in another, so our local coalitions and Labs tailor solutions to local realities.","acronym":"WF","interests":"Consumers, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"Net neutrality and GDPR.","lastUp":"2019-02-15T13:35:27.271+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
