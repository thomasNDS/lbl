In 1975 its place was taken by the current Holding of the group founded by the six&#xd;<br />Codognotto brothers. The beginning of their staggering growth is more recent though, starting in the midst of the&#xd;<br />economic crisis. While a number of companies were closing down, the Group started internationalizing by&#xd;<br />investing in infrastructure, technologies and human resources. As described by the International Transport Journal&#xd;<br />“today the group is seen as one of the leaders of the industry, showing incredible strength when faced with new&#xd;<br />challenges”. The interest in the company is due to its growing rate in the last years which is around 15%.&#xd;<br />Nowadays, Codognotto Group has a turnover of 200 M (160M transport and logistics while 40M manufactures).&#xd;<br />It has more than 5,000 customers, 3,500 deliveries per week and 950 employees.&#xd;<br />Among its fleet it can count 1,500 semitrailers and 600 trucks. Furthermore, it is able to manage all modes of&#xd;<br />transport operating with different BUs.","acronym":"COD","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Customs, Digital economy and society, Energy, Environment, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Taxation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Euroepan Territorial Cooperation Programmes&#xd;<br />Horizon 2020 R&amp;I Programme (IA and RIA actions)&#xd;<br />Connecting Europe Facilities - CEF&#xd;<br />TEN-T Corridor Policies&#xd;<br />Sustainability and alternative fuels policies&#xd;<br />DG MOVE Political Initiatives in general","lastUp":"2018-10-04T09:16:03.867+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
