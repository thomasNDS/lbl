We believe this will be particularly crucial in the area of digital, with huge potential benefits for all who live, invest and work in the European Union.  We recognize that industry needs to think more collaboratively, more creatively and more constructively,  challenge existing thinking on policy, and build constructive partnerships with policy makers. We are not a trade association and we do not pretend to have all the answers. We want to focus on identifying the right questions and providing a unique environment for honest and frank exchanges of views and perspectives.","acronym":"DPRT","interests":"Business and Industry, Competition, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Single market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"Digital policy, single market, competitiveness, trade, industrial policy, institutional reforms.","lastUp":"2019-07-04T10:43:09.310+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
