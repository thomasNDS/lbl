Not only are we active in research projects, the Unifly UTM platform is a deployed product that is currently in use by prominent European air navigation service providers.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We will demonstrate aspects of UTM that are deployed in Europe and will be available in the US in the short term. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Drone technology is on the rise and the number of drones in the air increases at an exponential rate. Unfortunately, drones are hard to detect and they often fly literally below the radar. As a result, the chance of conflicts between drones and manned air traffic is also on the rise.Unifly has the technology available today to help manage and control the integration of drones in your local airspace.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Unifly’s Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) platform connects official entities with operators to integrate drones into the airspace safely and securely. The Unifly approach offers a step-by-step, futureproof path towards a full solution. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Unifly UTM system provides a comprehensive feature set for both authorities and drone operators.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Unifly UTM offers drone users tools that inform them about the rules and situations at a given location. These rules are often complex and there are many variables to consider.  The system parses the underlying rules and real-time information to give the user a clear answer in a user-friendly way. Drone operators can register drone pilots and drones, and can proactively plan and validate drone flights to make sure these flights do not violate any national and/or local rules. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The main software engine takes care of the drone operational support and flight validation. It uses airspace information, regulatory data, meteorological data, user data, drone data, traffic data (manned and unmanned) and obstacle data input to feed its rule-based engine. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Authorities, including police, emergency services and municipalities, can visualize and manage drone flights and define no-drone zones, enabling dynamic drone flight and airspace management including real-time drone surveillance and tracking. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />They can register drones, pilots and drone operators in a central database. The local and national regulations can be entered and adapted using a rule engine and validation rules.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />This makes it possible to not only follow the drones in real-time, but also to determine who is flying where and whether they are supposed to be there. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The database contains all the data needed by authorities to manage the drone-pilot- population and perform both pre-flight validation of the flight and conflict resolution if the flight path is in conflict with any obstacle, traffic or regulatory limitation. The supervisory portal modules create customer-specific workflows and a unique working environment. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The platform combines all these data to validate and manage the flights in real-time. Unifly supports SWIM standards, the standard protocol in aviation, to communicate with the world of manned aviation.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Unifly application and service portfolio was designed to be a global, highly scalable cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) solution supporting users all over the world. The Unifly software is hardware agnostic and can be deployed on any cloud platform. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The UTM system successfully tackles the challenge of handling the complex and dynamic European regulatory framework. This is characterized by fragmentation on both national and local level. The multilingual user interface provided by the Unifly solution is essential for maximizing the user-friendliness and user acceptance.","acronym":"","interests":"Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Consumers, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"- Horizon2020 / SESAR2020&#xd;<br />- JARUS SCB WG UTM&#xd;<br />- EuroCAE WG-105&#xd;<br />- European Commission - Smart Cities / Smart Mobility&#xd;<br />- European Commission - Unmanned aircraft / UTM&#xd;<br />- Commission Delegated Regulation on unmanned aircraft systems&#xd;<br />- Commission draft paper on U-space","lastUp":"2019-10-17T11:52:03.528+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
