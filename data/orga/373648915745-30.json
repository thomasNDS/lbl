It is moved by the same&#xd;<br />the objectives of the 2005 UNESCO Convention on cultural diversity.&#xd;<br />We know that we live a moment of model change in the funding and management of culture and arts.And we are convinced about the contribution of creative industries to job creation and economic growth. Not only in Europe, but also in less developed regions. That is, creative industries are also a tool of development.&#xd;<br />We also assume that technology and new media have created new connections between arts and culture and other players of social and economic life.&#xd;<br />CUMEDIAE and its network of professionals try to be at the center of these changes, and we build, advice or manage cross border projects around them. Among others, we are running the wiki platform Culture Agora, www.cultureagora.info.&#xd;<br />As a non-profit organization, while we do not work for free, there is no profit or dividend for CUMEDIAE beyond remuneration to its professionals and the cover of expenses.","acronym":"CUMEDIAE","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Communication, Culture, Development, External Relations, Humanitarian Aid, Information Society, Youth","euInitiatives":"We follow EU calls for tenders and calls for proposals in the fields of creative industries and culture; we are interested in all policies related to culture and creativity.
