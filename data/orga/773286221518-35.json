The Visegrád Cooperation (V4) plays a central role in the life and activities of the Knowledge Centre, as the very concept of the V4 (four central European countries: Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Poland and Hungary) was created by József Antall.&#xd;<br />This institution has become renowned in the region due to its international projects including conferences, trainings, workshops and internship programmes. The establishment of the Brussels Office will enable to transcend regional boundaries and represent the legacy and values of Prime Minister Antall at European level.&#xd;<br />In particular, the centre also aims to offer events to discuss policy issues affecting the Central and Eastern European region as well as to organise cultural and professional programmes to promote the diversity of Hungarian culture and the country’s many-sided scientific pursuits for the international community. Our institution emphasises the importance of talent scouting and management. Academic work is built on university students in BA and MA programmes, as well as PhD students.&#xd;<br />Finally, the Knowledge Centre also carries out research activities and launches publications in the field of political and social sciences.&#xd;<br />AJKC is gradually expanding its international relations, and seeks cooperation with national and international institutions with a similar profile.","acronym":"AJKC","interests":"Borders and Security, Budget, Culture, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Energy, Enlargement, European Neighbourhood Policy, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"-Enlargement&#xd;<br />-Foreign and security policy&#xd;<br />-Migration and Home Affairs&#xd;<br />-Sustainability goals (mobility, health, youth)&#xd;<br />-European public policy","lastUp":"2019-12-02T14:46:54.688+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
