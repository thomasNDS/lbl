JMI offers a Master's degree in journalism and new media - the first of its kind in the Arab region in terms of curricula and methodology of teaching. Around 90% of JMI students are employed upon graduation. JMI also provides capacity building programs to the public to benefit journalists, public relations professionals, civil society and NGO personnel from Jordan and abroad. Over the past 10 years, JMI has been able to bring about a change of how media is perceived and practiced. Just recently, JMI managed to set up an association for the local and community radios in Jordan, a long-awaited establishment that will define community media here. JMI has also made a case for introducing curricula on media literacy on the university entry-level. The effort has been sanctioned by the Ministry of Higher Education. JMI has also launched the Human Rights Reporting Award. This has been achieved through partnership with national and international organizations such as the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, the Office of the Information and Communications Technology Minister, universities, municipalities, the USAID, the EU, UNESCO, the Norwegian Institute of Journalism, The Radio Netherlands Training Center.
