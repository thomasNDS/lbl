Thirty countries now allow accompanying spouses or partners to work. We continue to promote best practice and monitor legislative improvements in all these countries, as well as setting up new projects (for example, in Brazil and Indonesia) in our global campaign.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our surveys show that governments that allow partners to work attract highly skilled employees associated with international business, investment and development; creating a ‘triple win’ for host countries, employers and families alike.","acronym":"","interests":"Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Employment and Social Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Migration and asylum","euInitiatives":"Highly-skilled and legal migration policies, in particular Blue Card Directive and its revision, Intra-Corporate Transferee Directive, Family Reunification Directive and EU integration initiatives.
