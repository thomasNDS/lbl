Our members’ products are incorporated into vehicles on the assembly line, at the dealers, as well as in the aftermarket and are also sought after for motorsports and off-road use. The specialty equipment and tuning industry is an important economic engine. This industry of hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises generates tens of thousands of jobs and billions of tax Euros in sales on the Continent and overseas. Demand for accessories and performance products transcends national borders with motorists in all 27 member states seeking to personalize their vehicles and to upgrade their “ride”.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENVIRONMENT/SAFETY:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our industry has played a key role in devising products which makes vehicles safer and more environmental friendly.

At a time of skyrocketing fuel prices, eco tuning involves the fine-tuning of the engine with an aftermarket optimization kit to run more efficiently and consume less fuel.","acronym":"ETO","interests":"Business and Industry, Competition, Consumers, Customs, Energy, Environment, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Transport","euInitiatives":"Revision of 2007/46/EC, Regulation (EU) 2018/858&#xd;<br />Mutual recognition legislation&#xd;<br />Insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles Directive 2009/103/EC &#xd;<br />Automotive related legislation&#xd;<br />SME`s","lastUp":"2019-02-16T02:25:16.850+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
