In addition to the advocacy mission, Forum Droghe has largely invested in the field of information, by the magazine Fuoriluogo, distributed as a monthly supplement to the national daily paper Il Manifesto until 2009, and the website www.fuoriluogo.it. The site (www.fuoriluogo.it), deals specifically with drug policies, justice and prison policies, Harm Reduction policies and interventions and other social issues, at both national and international level. &#xd;<br />Since the 2000s, Forum Droghe has also developed research activities, in the field of both the evaluation of drug legislation and in patterns of drug use, in the effort of linking evidence from studies in natural settings to models of intervention in drug services. Training courses addressed to drug addiction professionals are also organized, to promote the most innovative models in Harm Reduction interventions.","acronym":"FD","interests":"Communication, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health","euInitiatives":"Since 2007, Forum Droghe has been partner member of International Drug Policy Consortium, taking part in the debate on European and international drug policies and on the role of NGOs in elaborating policies at international level.
