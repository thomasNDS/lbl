EAST was formed as the European ATM Security Team to act as a cross-border working group, linking security professionals in the ATM industry (and other terminals that have a security impact on the ATM industry) with international law enforcement agencies and prosecutors.  In 2017 EAST changed its name to become the European Association for Secure Transactions.  &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our mission is to gather and provide information to the payments industry and to facilitate effective representation of payment and terminal related security issues at relevant European central institutions, through a pan-European co-ordination of security resources.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />EAST has set up a framework network structure to improve co-operation with industry, law enforcement, and in particular Europol, in order to achieve awareness and better results in the fight against organised cross-border crime.","acronym":"EAST","interests":"Banking and financial services, Communication, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Foreign affairs and security policy","euInitiatives":"Participation in the Euro Cash Users Group (ECUG)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Liaison with and support of the European Police Office (Europol) - In 2015 Europol and EAST signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to formalise the working relationship.
