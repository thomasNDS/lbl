It is a non-profit and independent institute with the legal form of a limited liability company (GmbH). ZEW was founded in 1990 on the basis of a public-private initiative in the Federal State of Baden-Württemberg in co-operation with the University of Mannheim.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ZEW's guiding mission is to study the \"optimal performance of markets and institutions in Europe\". The institute co-operates closely with other scientific disciplines to address research questions. In this context, the research institute distinguishs itself, inter alia, in the analysis of internationally comparative questions in the European context and in the creation of data bases which are eminently important as a basis for scientific research. In addition, ZEW provides external persons and bodies with excerpts of selected data stocks for the purpose of scientific research.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Evaluations in regular intervals ensure the quality of the work performed in the research units and its orientation towards the institute's research programme.
