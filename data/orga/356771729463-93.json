Their focus is on the citizen and consumer and their privacy. These fundamentally depend on assured identity and digital authentication – knowing that a person is who they claim to be.   Unfortunately, identity fraud and theft is the top enabler of crime, so Governments, the EU and other authorities are introducing legislation for greater accountability and traceability that depend upon assured identity.  Within the EU, banks have to comply with 17 new digitally-based regulations, all depending on identity, most notably GDPR, AML4 and PSD2, which requires Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for transactions above €10.&#xd;<br />Globalisation and cross-border movement requires that any approach and solutions work across borders, which requires identity interoperability and federation across multiple authorities. From an industry perspective, this requires capability re-use, to enable business agility and minimisation of risk and cost.  Leading governments and industries realise this is not about technology, but about quality data and its foundational dependency, assured identity.&#xd;<br />Some banks and FinTechs are working to achieve first mover advantage in the market for re-usable authoritative customer data.   They are putting the customer at the centre of their digital banking.&#xd;<br />Banks are required to comply with KYC legislation during customer on-boarding for which they rely upon documentary evidence before they can open an account.  This can take weeks.  The paper-centric process is costly, significantly vulnerable to fraud and error, and it is only a snapshot.  As customer data changes, the KYC record fails to update, resulting in further inefficiencies, risks and costs, to the point where the bank can no longer contact existing customers. &#xd;<br />A situation can then arise where a bank is unable to innovate and compete well because its data quality is insufficient and its management is preoccupied with the increased risks and costs of regulatory violation.  &#xd;<br />There is an urgent requirement for much stronger digital KYC that leverages authoritative source data in a much faster, re-usable and cost-effective process, and that keeps this data up-to-date automatically.&#xd;<br />Sedicii meets these requirements.  Its Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology allows two entities (people, organisations, devices) to prove to each other that they have the same data without the need to expose any data to each other.  Sedicii can be applied to a wide range of information, in particular to personal data such as a public services card, passport, birthdate, gender, nationality, name and address details. &#xd;<br />For KYC, Sedicii enables the user to check the data in a passport or ID card against the issuing government authority’s database, which independently notifies the bank of the outcome, all without sharing or exposing the private data or exchanging passwords.  Further, the bank is separately notified of any changes e.g. (lost or stolen passport) and passport renewals.   All relying parties are informed of any updates to KYC documents, with explicit user consent.  The user is in control, but they are also exposed if they refuse to comply with legal requirements to keep their information up to date.  &#xd;<br />Sedicii has more capabilities.  One is the ability for a government agency or a bank and a utility to check whether the name and address for each of their customers is the same, notifying the customer where it is not and asking the customer to update the wrong address. The government agency or bank can clean its customer data and help the customer manage their data at the same time.  The value of the customer data is increased and the agency’s or bank’s relationship with each customer is strengthened.  &#xd;<br />Sedicii is also exploring the use of ZKP with blockchain technology as a means to executing the value exchange that occurs when an identity is digitally verified.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Banking and financial services, Borders and Security, Business and Industry, Communication, Consumers, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, European Neighbourhood Policy, Foreign affairs and security policy, Fraud prevention, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Sedicii actively follows the GDPR, eIDAS, PSD2, 4th AMLD legislative agendas.","lastUp":"2019-11-07T16:49:34.422+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
