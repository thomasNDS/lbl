The association represents and promotes the common interests of the European-based semiconductor industry towards the European Institutions and other stakeholders in order to ensure a sustainable business environment and foster its global competitiveness.&#xd;<br />Its mission is to:&#xd;<br />1. debate and take into account all the questions of common interest&#xd;<br />2. coordinate on trade rules, Digital Single Market, environmental and safety rules on an European basis&#xd;<br />Since 1997, ESIA represents the European Semiconductor Industry in the World Semiconductor Council (WSC). Together with the semiconductor industry associations of China, Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea and the United States, ESIA shapes the agenda of the WSC. The Joint Steering Committee (JSTC) of the WSC meets three times a year. In Spring, a JSTC working-level meeting is organised, followed by the CEO-led WSC meeting in May, which in turn prepares the Joint Statement as basis for the Governments/Authorities Meeting on Semiconductors (GAMS) in Autumn. The European GAMS delegation is chaired by Directorate-General for Trade.","acronym":"EECA","interests":"Business and Industry, Customs, Digital economy and society, Environment, Foreign affairs and security policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Trade","euInitiatives":"Artificial Intelligence, Connected &amp; Automated Driving, Internet of Things&#xd;<br />Chemicals management, REACH regulation, RoHS 2 directive&#xd;<br />Counterfeiting issues&#xd;<br />Cybersecurity&#xd;<br />Digital Single Market&#xd;<br />European Strategy for Micro- and Nanoelectronics, Horizon Europe, Digital Europe&#xd;<br />Export control&#xd;<br />Information Technology Agreement (ITA)&#xd;<br />Intellectual property and patent issues&#xd;<br />Trade issues&#xd;<br />Union Customs Code","lastUp":"2019-06-05T17:58:29.567+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
