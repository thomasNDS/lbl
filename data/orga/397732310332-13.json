It is the&#xd;<br />largest of Germany’s 16 federal states, and the&#xd;<br />number one exporter. If classified as an&#xd;<br />independent exporting nation, NRW would&#xd;<br />rank 18th in the world, on a par with the&#xd;<br />Netherlands.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />North Rhine-Westphalia’s state government&#xd;<br />has established a number of technology&#xd;<br />clusters to systematically improve NRW’s&#xd;<br />strengths and talents in established industries&#xd;<br />and up-and-coming fields like biotechnology.&#xd;<br />Goal of the “ExcellenceNRW”&#xd;<br />cluster strategy is to create a favourable&#xd;<br />climate for innovation, as that is the best&#xd;<br />way to sustain the competitive edge and&#xd;<br />stimulate growth and employment in the&#xd;<br />companies that call the state their home.&#xd;<br />North Rhine-Westphalia’s biotechnology&#xd;<br />cluster BIO.NRW is a central catalyst for&#xd;<br />the sustainable development of the state’s&#xd;<br />biotech sector.
