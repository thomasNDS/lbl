It is the&#xd;<br />largest of Germany’s 16 federal states, and the&#xd;<br />number one exporter. If classified as an&#xd;<br />independent exporting nation, NRW would&#xd;<br />rank 18th in the world, on a par with the&#xd;<br />Netherlands.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />North Rhine-Westphalia’s state government&#xd;<br />has established a number of technology&#xd;<br />clusters to systematically improve NRW’s&#xd;<br />strengths and talents in established industries&#xd;<br />and up-and-coming fields like biotechnology.&#xd;<br />Goal of the “ExcellenceNRW”&#xd;<br />cluster strategy is to create a favourable&#xd;<br />climate for innovation, as that is the best&#xd;<br />way to sustain the competitive edge and&#xd;<br />stimulate growth and employment in the&#xd;<br />companies that call the state their home.&#xd;<br />North Rhine-Westphalia’s biotechnology&#xd;<br />cluster BIO.NRW is a central catalyst for&#xd;<br />the sustainable development of the state’s&#xd;<br />biotech sector. It activates cooperation&#xd;<br />between business, research, investors and&#xd;<br />policy-makers. The cluster also promotes&#xd;<br />the strengths and achievements of biotechnology&#xd;<br />in the state.&#xd;<br />To support young as well as already established&#xd;<br />biotech companies, BIO.NRW offers&#xd;<br />the following core competencies:&#xd;<br />– Individual matchmaking for collaborations&#xd;<br />and partners&#xd;<br />– Overview on all up-to-date R&amp;D activities&#xd;<br />in industry and academia&#xd;<br />– Profound knowledge on financing possibilities&#xd;<br />– International promotion and marketing&#xd;<br />for NRW as biotech location&#xd;<br />-\tDirect contacts to decision makers&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our services include:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Technology Transfer&#xd;<br />Tech transfer support is a key contribution from BIO.NRW. We organize events, working platforms and meetings to promote the dialogue between all stakeholders in the field of biotechnology and to activate cooperation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Biotech Business &amp; Sciences&#xd;<br />BIO.NRW compiles comprehensive and current&#xd;<br />online databases of the academic institutions&#xd;<br />and companies active in the life sciences&#xd;<br />in NRW. Free to access and easy-to-use, these&#xd;<br />resources are valuable tools for identifying&#xd;<br />business partners.&#xd;<br />More information on www.bio.nrw.de&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Fairs, Exhibitions and Conferences&#xd;<br />Companies and academic institutions can&#xd;<br />generate awareness of their activities locally,&#xd;<br />nationally and internationally by being a part&#xd;<br />of the BIO.NRW common stands on fairs,&#xd;<br />exhibitions and conferences.

The ‘Business Angel&#xd;<br />Network – BIO.NRW’ helps financing and&#xd;<br />funding biotech start-ups. In addition, a forum&#xd;<br />that brings together investment institutions,&#xd;<br />private investors and business angels&#xd;<br />and developers provides information about&#xd;<br />the current NRW biotech scene. These meetings are a valuable opportunity for start-up companies to receive coaching and financing.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />To learn more about the Cluster BIO.NRW&#xd;<br />and to stay informed about the latest&#xd;<br />biotech developments in NRW please visit&#xd;<br />www.bio.nrw.de.","acronym":"BIO.NRW","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Energy, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"Roadmaps and Public Consultations regarding Energy, Development, Climat Protection, Public Health, Technology Policy","lastUp":"2019-02-07T12:16:10.503+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
