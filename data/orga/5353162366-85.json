CEO believes that the Transparency Register fails basic transparency standards and does not yet live up to its name. We support ALTER-EU's demand for a legally-binding register, stronger safeguards against inaccurate reporting, and the publication of the names of all individual interest representatives.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />When registering, we have chosen to provide additional information that we consider necessary and relevant for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective monitoring and sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of Corporate Europe Observatory, carry out such activities. Our registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU.
