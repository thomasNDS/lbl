We promote open trade and investment&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We promote open markets for trade and investment. We place the free flow of goods and services, and the creation of a favourable environment for investment between the EU and Japan at the top of our agenda.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We support the deepening of EU-Japan trade relations through an ambitious Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and fair market access that will contribute substantially to industrial growth and job creation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Beyond bilateral agreements, we foster cooperation between the EU and Japan to realise new multilateral agreements in the World Trade Organisation in order to bring economic advantages to all parties.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We support the timely development of business and strive to remove the administrative hurdles that our member companies face when integrating their European activities, for example when dispatching executives or transferring personal data between the two regions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. We encourage a common regulatory framework&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Businesses, wherever they are based, need a clear legal and regulatory framework to effectively operate and grow. Instead of a fragmented situation, they need international standards to be able to compete on a level playing field and to contribute to economic growth.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Mutual engagement from the EU and Japan for better regulatory cooperation is crucial to foster sustainable competitiveness and smart innovation in both economies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We promote the implementation of common regulatory frameworks and international standards in a number of sectors in order to enable Japanese and European companies to operate in a predictable and harmonised regulatory environment.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our member companies have a long history of pursuing sustainability and are strongly committed to environmental legislation. This is why we stand for increased international cooperation and harmonisation of environmental regulations and standards in key policy areas such as energy efficiency, environmental footprint, and chemical substance management.","lastUp":"2019-07-16T09:50:23.857+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
