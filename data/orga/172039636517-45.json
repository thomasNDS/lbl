There has been a healthy growth in membership with EPSA represented in 10 countries and products distributed throughout Europe. With the average age of the world population increasing, and governments more sensitive to the problems of elderly people and those with impaired mobility, there has been a much increased demand for products that allow improved access.&#xd;<br />The growing need for these products meant that it was important to harmonise European regulations, overcoming the confusion caused by the differing laws in each country.&#xd;<br />European manufacturers recognise the needs of people with impaired mobility, as well as knowing that planners and architects need information and assistance.  As such, EPSA and our members work to match the requirements of everyday users, and building design, with current regulations.","acronym":"EPSA","interests":"Business and Industry, Environment, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Public Health, Transport","euInitiatives":"We are attending since year 2000 the work of the Machinery Directive Working Group.
