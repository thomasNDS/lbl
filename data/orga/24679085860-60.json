On the one hand, galleries have to fulfil their special task of promoting artists and promoting art, and on the other hand they have to survive in the economic competition. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Association of German Galleries and Fine Art Dealers (BVDG) has around 350 members, the union is the world's largest association of gallerists and fine art dealers and is furthermore part of Federation of European Art Galleries Associations (F.E.A.G.A.).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The BVDG awards every year in collaboration with the KOELNMESSE GmbH, the trade fair company behind ART COLOGNE the COLOGNE FINE ART FAIR (COFA), two relevant art prizes: In spring, the ART COLOGNE Prize for outstanding achievements in art education, and the COLOGNE FINE ART Prize for established, well known artists in autumn.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Since 1980, the Association of German Galleries and Fine Art Dealers (BVDG) has been organising the NEW POSITIONS at the ART COLOGNE, the funding programme for young and upcoming artists.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Association of German Galleries and Fine Art Dealers (BVDG) is an important partner and consultant for all topics relevant to the art market and art trade. It is widely consulted by politicians, journalists, art ciritcs, the media and various other institutions. &#xd;<br />It offers its members various services, advice and a network of competent and supportive cooperation partners.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The executive board and the management of the association is appointed to many committees. The associated voluntary activities enable the BVDG to wider its influence of art market-relevant contexts.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The BVDG is particularly committed to the profession of the gallerist, art publisher and fine art dealer: Gallery work, editing art and art trade differ considerably from other commercial activities. The gallery owner, art publisher or fine art dealer is not only a businessman, they also fulfil the special task of promoting artists, are acting as a mediator of artistic positions and are working as an advisor for collectors and  art buyers on a high level of personal trust. The art trade fulfils in that way an important cultural task.","acronym":"BVDG","interests":"Audiovisual and Media, Communication, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Customs, Development, Economic and Financial Affairs, Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Enterprise, External Relations, General and Institutional Affairs, Information Society, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and Technology, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"- EU-Mehrwertsteuersystem (Mehrwertsteuersystemrichtlinie) - Aufnahme von originalen Werken der bildenden Kunst in den Katalog der mehrwertsteuerbegünstigten Güter analog zu Musik und Literatur.&#xd;<br />- Kulturgutschutz&#xd;<br />- Folgerechtsregelungen - Urheberrecht&#xd;<br />- Künstlersozialversicherung","lastUp":"2018-02-27T11:26:10.162+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"200000-299999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
