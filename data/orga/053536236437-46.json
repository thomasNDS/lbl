The MOS-AK aspires to build a community with global connections by:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Promoting standardization of the compact models and its implementation into software tools&#xd;<br />Connecting national and local modeling groups on European level&#xd;<br />Building strong bilateral ties with similar organizations around the world&#xd;<br />MOS-AK Benchmarks:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The MOS-AK conducts regular meetings with European industry and academia to exchange information on the strengths and weaknesses of the industrialization of the compact models. Activities include:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Drafting of standards and providing a center of competence for engineers, designers, managers and decision makers&#xd;<br />Evaluating world-wide best practice and success stories&#xd;<br />Delivering a comprehensive view of the European compact modeling education&#xd;<br />MOS-AK Educates:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The MOS-AK believes that the transfer of the advanced compact modeling methodologies to industry can be accelerated by providing the comprehensive reports and reference papers on the subjects of:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Basic issues and concepts of the device characterization and compact modeling&#xd;<br />Global device characterization and compact modeling issues&#xd;<br />Examples and analysis of best practice of the commercialization of compact models","acronym":"MOS-AK","interests":"Education and training, International co-operation and development, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"non","lastUp":"2019-11-01T13:50:33.753+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
