Our vision is to end cruelty to animals in Ireland. Our Mission is that through education, legislation and ongoing support for our affiliated member organisations we can prevent cruelty to all animals. Our objective is to prevent cruelty, alleviate suffering and to promote kindness to animals. The ISPCA operates three animal centres in Ireland where animals that have been cruelly treated, abused or neglected, receive veterinary treatment, are rehabilitated and then responsibly rehomed. The ISPCA also operates a national cruelty helpline and a team of uniformed Inspectors who investigate allegations of animal cruelty. The ISPCA is also an advocacy organisation, lobbying for stronger protection for animals in Ireland and the EU.","acronym":"ISPCA","interests":"Agriculture, Environment","euInitiatives":"The ISPCA is a member of Eurogroup for Animals http://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/ and the EU Dog and Cat Alliance https://www.dogandcatwelfare.eu/. &#xd;<br />The ISPCA has a strong interest in EU polices on animal welfare and as a member of the above organisations, lobby both nationally and at the EU level for stronger animal welfare legislation.
