This includes the development, testing and manufacture of autocatalysts, ceramic substrates and specialty materials incorporated into the catalytic converter and filter and catalyst based technologies to control engine emissions (especially particulates and nitrogen oxides). Members' technology is incorporated in the exhaust emissions control systems of new cars, commercial vehicles, buses, non-road mobile machinery and motorcycles in Europe.&#xd;<br />The principal objectives of the Association are:&#xd;<br />- to foster and promote the use of state-of-the-art technologies for the control of harmful emissions from mobile sources;&#xd;<br />- to collect and disseminate information concerning laws and regulations, safety and environmental concerns, studies relating to vehicle exhaust emissions and methods for their control;&#xd;<br />- to promote the harmonisation of technical standards, test procedures and safety regulations;&#xd;<br />- to sponsor scientific research programmes related to the objectives of the Association and disseminate the results at conferences and in scientific publications.","acronym":"AECC","interests":"Business and Industry, Climate Action, Consumers, Energy, Environment, Public Health, Research and innovation, Single market, Transport","euInitiatives":"Emissions from mobile sources: Post Euro 6/VI, Real-Driving Emissions Light-duty vehicles (RDE LDV), EU-World Harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure(EU WLTP), Non-Road Mobile Machinery Engines Emissions (GEME), Motor Vehicle Emissions Group (MVEG), Working Group on Motor Vehicles (MVWG), Working Group on Agricultural Tractors (WGAT), Heavy-duty vehicle emissions, Fitness Check of the EU Ambient Air Quality Directives, Roadworthiness and periodic technical inspection","lastUp":"2019-09-07T09:51:04.739+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
