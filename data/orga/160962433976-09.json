We develop tools, establish projects and conduct events all over the world to achieve this goal.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Capacity Building&#xd;<br />We are committed to raising the next generation of peacebuilders. Young women leaders are the key to ensuring lasting peace and stability. Our internship programs provide young women access to mentors and opportunities to develop their professionalism in the areas of diplomacy, advocacy, strategic planning, research, and media.

The inherent feminine characteristics of empathy, nurturing and cooperation are pivotal to creating a more harmonious society. By centering on universally shared values, we strengthen families and offer women the tools they need to take ownership in the education of their community, which can then expand to the world.","lastUp":"2019-02-15T15:46:14.837+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
