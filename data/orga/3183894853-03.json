Public Affairs can create decisive competitive advantage and open market opportunities. Growing competition to influence public policy means that public affairs approaches have to be more sophisticated and creative. In addition, they should not be stand-alone options but an integral part of an organisation's planning of its business and corporate communications strategies.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We believe that communication has the power to create change and that real change only occurs with effective, powerful communication. Communication is the heart of what makes us human, what makes the world go round, and what we at Hill &amp; Knowlton do day in and day out in 81 offices in 43 countries around the globe. Powerful communications that make a difference, that go beyond the ordinary, that can transform, inspire, move and educate is why we exist. This power can be accessed by our clients wherever and whenever they need it; in specialist arenas and in global campaigns; in the corridors of government; in the financial centres and in the minds of consumers everywhere.","acronym":"H+K","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Banking and financial services, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Given Hill+Knowlton Strategies' broad client base, our advice to our clients focuses on all areas of EU policy making.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />These range from energy and environment, transport, financial services, food and consumer affairs, sustainability, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, agriculture and fisheries, information and communication technologies, media, defence, intellectual property, professional services, diplomatic relations, travel, chemicals and industrial policies.","lastUp":"2020-01-16T10:50:05.549+01:00","customers":"Mazda Motor Europe","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1250000-1499999","turnoverAbsolu":"","turnoverRange":""}
