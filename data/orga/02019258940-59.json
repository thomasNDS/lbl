Our work is organised into four main programmes: Freshwater; Forests and Protected Areas (including Natura 2000); Policy and Green Economy, and Education for Sustainable Development.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The WWF-DCP has played a major role in the development of framework political agreements, including e.g. the Carpathian Convention, and the Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement. WWF DCP has Observer Status at the ICPDR and participates actively in the most important expert and political meetings. More recently, WWF-DCP has begun developing practical models demonstrating conservation and sustainable livelihoods, e.g. through a range of approaches including development of payments for ecosystem services. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />WWF-DCP has a dedicated Communication team and works with a variety of communication tools, from websites to electronic newsletters and printed materials, and conducts highly successful media relations.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The WWF Danube-Carpathian Program presently has a staff of about 125 with a co-ordination office in Vienna and field offices in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Ukraine and Slovakia, as well as representatives and partner organizations in Croatia, and Serbia.","acronym":"WWF-DCPO","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Energy, Environment, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Regional Policy","euInitiatives":"EU Strategy for the Danube Region, CAP, Cohesion Policy, EU Timber Regulation, Birds and Habitats Directives, Water Framework Directive, EIA and SEA Directives, TEN-T, Climate policy, EU Accession, Aarhus Directive","lastUp":"2019-04-10T10:06:01.873+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
