Based on a public international competition (the annual call for ideas) it selects, the best collaborative and transnational partnerships bringing together SMEs, Research Institutes, End Users and big industry.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In the AAL Programme, we promote business, technology and social innovation, especially that based on ICT, to ensure that products, systems and services give effective support to older adults in their everyday lives. These solutions are being used by or for older people to enhance their quality of life in the context of active and healthy ageing.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In our vision, business innovation and the application of technology-based solutions will enable people to live their lives to the fullest, where and how they choose. For the AAL Programme, older adults are more than just an age category with specific needs: we place people first, with their wishes and aspirations. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We envision a society in which the application of technology and innovative new services and systems creates a level playing field for all, with regard to both consumer markets and services provided to the public. Furthermore, these technologies and services have the clear potential to generate jobs and boost the growing Silver Economy.","acronym":"AAL","interests":"Competition, Internal Market, Public Health","euInitiatives":"AAL launches every year a call for proposals in a given theme in the field of digital solutions for active and healthy ageing. The publication of the call happens in the first quarter of the year and the deadline for preparing and submitting the entries is after four months.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />The programme co-funds projects within the innovation and user-driven-innovation models between a minimum three partners from AAL member States or Regions. It is important to recognize that the AAL – due to the special way of integrating partner States and Regions, and the European Commission – has its own rules of participation and own funding procedures.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />In AAL, several partner States join their individual funding programmes under a common topic. The European Commission rewards this common activity by granting a subsidy to the AAL in a certain percentage relative to the joint funds from the partner States. But for the appliers, this is completely transparent since the only interlocutor is the National Funding Agency.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />For all this, AAL operates mainly within the Horizon 2020 initiative framework, at the crossroad between the Digital Single Market and the Sociatal Challenges","lastUp":"2018-03-08T15:40:53.442+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"900000-999999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
