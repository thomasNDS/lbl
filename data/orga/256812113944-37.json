It is a not for profit, non-religious organisation open to all peoples.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />OUR AIMS:&#xd;<br />To promote Europe’s rich religious heritage, which is a shared resource for cultural, social and economic development.&#xd;<br />To raise awareness of the threats facing Europe’s religious heritage.&#xd;<br />To provide a communication platform for those working to protect Europe’s religious heritage.&#xd;<br />To share expertise and experience on common challenges as well as promote successful national or regional initiatives at a European level.&#xd;<br />To identify areas where a Europe-wide response is appropriate and influence policy-makers on behalf of our members.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Religious heritage buildings are under threat across Europe. Shrinking congregations, financial distress and lack of knowledge about conserving the buildings and treasures held within them, all contribute to this impeding loss of a substantial collection of testaments to European history and intangible heritage. FRH was formed with support from numerous organisations in several European countries to create a unified voice for the many European organisations that are working hard to mitigate the detrimental consequences of this trend for religious heritage. FRH acts as a link between practitioners and policymakers and as a platform for communication across countries, cultures and religions, exchanging knowledge and experience of common issues.","acronym":"FRH","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Communication, Culture, Culture and media, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, International co-operation and development, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"The communication on An integrated approach of cultural heritage presented by the commision in july 2014 - and all related communication and/or actitivities in the EU institutions.
