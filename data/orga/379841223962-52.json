We translate complex issues into workable solutions. We have worked for many international organisations, countries and regions.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />OUR SERVICES&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />For over a decade we have been working with our clients towards effective and efficient policy making by simplifying rules and regulations, optimising government processes and improving service-delivery. We see it as part of our broader, social responsibility to make a contribution to economic growth, job creation, public participation and good governance. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We will give you a short introduction to our services:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1. Regulatory reform&#xd;<br />The aim of regulatory reform projects is to provide an accurate insight into the quantitative and qualitative impact of rules and regulations. Also, we identify regulatory burden reduction measures. We have executed a large number of these projects for public administrations in different countries. During these projects we piece together a complete picture of all the effects of rules and regulations, together with relevant stakeholders. Based on this, we can identify and help to implement reduction measures designed to achieve direct and tangible improvements. These regulatory reform projects contribute directly to the prevention of future regulatory burden.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />You can find more information about our regulatory reform services on our website:&#xd;<br />- AB baseline measurements&#xd;<br />- Regulatory Impact Assessments&#xd;<br />- Reducing regulatory with CAR (sector approach)&#xd;<br />- Reducing regulatory burdens with SCM (legal approach)&#xd;<br />- Designing regulatory reform&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. How local governments can cut red tape&#xd;<br />The aim of red tape reduction projects for local authorities is to provide them with the tools they need to improve the ease of doing business and to stimulate economic growth and employment opportunities in the local economy. During these projects we look at a variety of key indicators for service delivery and analyse the way in which regulations have been translated into core processes. Based on this, we can improve service delivery by redesigning regulations or requirements and optimising core processes. We draw upon our experience with reducing red tape in over 300 municipalities, provinces and other regional authorities.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />You can find more information about our services for local governments on our website:&#xd;<br />- Reducing local red tape&#xd;<br />- Improving public services&#xd;<br />- Conducting local Impact Assessments&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />3. Boost your red tape reduction skills&#xd;<br />The aim of our training program is to share our knowledge and experience with you, and provide you with all the tools necessary to successfully initiate and implement regulatory burden reduction programs. That can be challenging. A certain amount of experience is required to fully understand the causes of regulatory burden and which solutions are most efficient and effective. All our trainers have over ten years of experience in carrying out regulatory burden reduction programs and baseline measurements. Our training program will be specifically tailored to your needs and we will work closely together to fill in any gaps in your knowledge and experience.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />You can find more information about our training program on our website:&#xd;<br />- In-house trainings for public authorities&#xd;<br />- Master Class regulatory reform&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ABOUT US&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Sira Consulting’s distinctive strengths are client-focus, expertise, and innovation.
