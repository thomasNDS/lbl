In countries without NaPHOS, medical institutions and treatment centres specialised in paediatric cancer care can join SIOPE. Such centres can allow the paediatric haemato-oncology professionals in their institute to also become members of SIOPE. To ensure an open and continuously growing community, oncology professionals who are not members of a NaPHOS can also join SIOPE.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nMembers contribute an annual membership fee of EUR 20. &#xd;\n&#xd;\nList of members: http://www.siope.eu/about-siope/members/","goal":"SIOPE's vision is to be the single voice of the Paediatric Haematology Oncology Community in Europe, representing all stakeholders involved in the field and including in particular national societies as well as the clinical trial and research groups.
