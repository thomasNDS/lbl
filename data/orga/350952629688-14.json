Each network partner recruits and develops promising future leaders to teach in their nations’ high-need schools and communities for at least two years, and with this foundation, to work with others, inside and outside of education, to ensure all children are able to fulfill their potential. Teach For All’s global organization works to accelerate the network’s progress and increase its impact by: i. capturing and spreading learning; ii. facilitating connections; iii. accessing global resources; and iv. fostering the leadership development of network organization’s  staff, teachers, and alumni. Meaningful, sustainable change requires leaders who are rooted in their local culture, challenges, and opportunities and who believe in the potential of children and their communities. Teach For All is developing collective leadership to improve education and expand opportunity for all children, so they can shape a better future for themselves and the world around them. Our vision is that in 2040, communities in every part of the world are enabling all of their children to have the education, support, and opportunity to shape a better future for themselves and all of us. These communities are inspiring and informing a worldwide movement to achieve this everywhere.","acronym":"TFAN","interests":"Education and training, Youth","euInitiatives":"Teach For All Networks' theory of change is aligned with several European Commission initiatives and policies.
