What is happening and what are the answers to the current economic and social transformations? &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In a globalized and digitalized world where men and objects are perpetually connected to each other, we seem unable to provide an analysis of the facts and consequently adequate responses to the needs of citizens. We provide a new perspective, a methodological framework that allows us to understand the phenomena and produce effective responses to improve the coexistence of citizens. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Competere offers analysis and moments of discussion among experts whose goal is to create an ecosystem that fosters innovation and free enterprise.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Ours is a team of highly qualified academics and professionals with a reputation that is recognized both within Italy and internationally. But above all, it is a team of curious, creative, and enterprising people who, first of all, want to discover the world and provide the best solutions to the problems they encounter.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our projects:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Industrial policies for innovation and development&#xd;<br />- ICT, Internet of things (IoT), automation and robotics, - smart working, smart home and smart city&#xd;<br />- Sharing economy&#xd;<br />- Intellectual property and trademarks protection&#xd;<br />- Big data, cybersecurity and protection of personal data&#xd;<br />- Geopolitical, global intelligence and thought-leadership analysis","acronym":"Competere","interests":"Business and Industry, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign affairs and security policy, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Research and innovation, Trade, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"- Food, agriculture &amp; nutrition&#xd;<br />- Energy&#xd;<br />- Industry &#xd;<br />- Intelligence &amp; security&#xd;<br />- Transport&#xd;<br />- Environment &amp; sustainable development&#xd;<br />- Technology &amp; science&#xd;<br />- Research &amp; innovation&#xd;<br />- Privacy &amp; data protection&#xd;<br />- Industry 4.0, smart city, smart working &amp; Internet of Things &#xd;<br />- Property &amp; trademark rights &#xd;<br />- Education","lastUp":"2019-09-06T16:21:08.816+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
