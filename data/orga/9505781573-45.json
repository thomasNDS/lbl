BEUC acts as the umbrella group in Brussels for these organisations and our main task is to represent our members and defend the interests of all Europe’s consumers.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />BEUC was created on 6 March 1962 by the consumer organisations of Belgium, Luxembourg, France, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. After working together for a number of years, these organisations decided to create a European association, based in Brussels.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />BEUC was a pioneer, one of the first lobbying organisations to set up base in the European capital in a bid to influence the decision-making process. To do this, we receive funding from our members, a grant from the European Union and we execute specific projects.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />BEUC is acknowledged as a trustworthy representative by both decision-makers and opponents alike, thanks in particular to the collective skills, knowledge and expertise of our member organisations. BEUC is fortunate to benefit directly from their experience and day-to-day contact with consumers at grass roots level. What is more, anyone dealing with BEUC can be sure that the position we present has received the backing of the most representative national consumer organisations. Through BEUC, these organisations are able to speak out with one voice.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />BEUC supports the empowerment of consumers through competitive markets, but complemented by health and safety safeguards. Only safe products and services, which do not put at risk our health, future generations or the environment, should be available on the EU market. In addition, regulatory measures must protect their economic and legal interests.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our prioritised topics are: Consumer Rights; Enforcement and Redress; Digital Rights; Energy; Financial Services; Food;  Sustainability; Trade; Safety; Health;","acronym":"BEUC","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, Food Safety, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"BEUC’s priorities are :&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Financial Services:  &#xd;<br />•\tBanking services&#xd;<br />•\tFinancial supervision &amp; regulation&#xd;<br />•\tInvestor protection&#xd;<br />•\tPayment services&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Food&#xd;<br />•\tCloning and novel food&#xd;<br />•\tFood information&#xd;<br />•\tFood safety&#xd;<br />•\tFood sustainability&#xd;<br />•\tHealth and nutrition claims&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Consumer Rights &amp; Enforcement;&#xd;<br />•\tPassenger rights &#xd;<br />•\tAlternative Dispute Resolution&#xd;<br />•\tCollective redress&#xd;<br />•\tConsumer Rights Directive&#xd;<br />and REFIT of the consumer aquis &#xd;<br />•\tE-commerce&#xd;<br />•\tEnforcement and competition law &#xd;<br />•\tUnfair commercial practices and contract terms&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Digital Rights; &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tCopyright&#xd;<br />•\tDigital Single market&#xd;<br />•\tGoogle Antitrust Investigation&#xd;<br />•\tPrivacy and personal data protection&#xd;<br />•\tTelecoms Single Market &#xd;<br />        Collaborative economy&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Sustainability. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tEcodesign &amp; Energy label&#xd;<br />•\tEcolabel&#xd;<br />•\tSustainable mobility&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Energy&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tEnergy consumer rights&#xd;<br />•\tEnergy markets&#xd;<br />•      Renewable energy&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We also work on &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Health &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tClinical trials&#xd;<br />•\teHealth&#xd;<br />•\tMedical devices &#xd;<br />•\tPharmaceuticals&#xd;<br />•       Access to Medicines &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Safety&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tChemicals&#xd;<br />•\tNanotechnology&#xd;<br />•\tProduct safety&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Trade/TTIP&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />For further information, please see our website:  www.beuc.eu","lastUp":"2019-03-27T16:49:02.052+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"2500000-2749000","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
