We promote simple, sustainable beekeeping – helping people in poor and remote areas of the world produce honey and beeswax, protect biodiversity, and keep bees healthy.  Most of our work is in developing countries, where since 1993 we have worked with, supported and listened to beekeepers to maintain and develop locally appropriate techniques for harvesting the products of bees while conserving local bee populations.  Healthy thriving bee populations allow people to harvest and market products that have value everywhere, improving livelihoods and reducing poverty.","acronym":"BfD","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Development, Education, Environment, Humanitarian Aid, Research and Technology, Trade","euInitiatives":"ORGANIC HONEY STANDARDS&#xd;<br />EUROPEAN UNION&#xd;<br />Council Regulation (EC) No 1804/1999 of 19 July 1999 supplementing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production.&#xd;<br />Official Journal L 222 , 24/08/1999 P. 0001 – 0028 &#xd;<br />EU.
