The NOAD’s work together to align national policies, define shared solutions and best practices. They also outreach and perform advocacy through a range of targeted training events and support materials.&#xd;<br />•\tMonitoring is achieved by means of an infrastructure composed of a decentralized network of data sources, namely publication repositories, data repositories, publishers, and current research information systems. By harnessing the contents of “compatible” publication and data repositories (both institutional and disciplinary) and linking them to other research entities (researchers, institutions, projects), OpenAIRE produces a 360 picture of the impact of European research funding.","acronym":"OpenAIRE","interests":"International co-operation and development, Regional Policy, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"Open Access to scientific information (publication and data)&#xd;<br />Digital Single Market (European Open Science Cloud)","lastUp":"2019-09-28T16:28:27.919+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
