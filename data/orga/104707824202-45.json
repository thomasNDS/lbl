In this sense, we are interested in how the kings and chiefs of Africa, Oceania and the Americas can work with the EU and the EU’s policies on development and cooperation, including the aim above all to eradicate poverty through a sustainable approach.  Accordingly, the document ‘A Decent Life for All: From Vision to Collective Action’ is particularly relevant to our approach.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are interested in seeing how traditional African, Oceanian leaders and those of the Americas, such as kings and chiefs, can work with the EU to try to become in control of their own futures and development, particularly in relation to the following issues:&#xd;<br />•\taddressing the causes of vulnerability, e.g. poor access to food, clean water, education, health, employment, land, social services, infrastructure and a healthy environment&#xd;<br />•\treducing developing countries' debt burden, so they have more money for vital public investments, instead of paying interest to rich lenders in industrialised countries&#xd;<br />•\tpromoting self-help and poverty-eradication strategies&#xd;<br />•\tsupporting the democratic process&#xd;<br />•\timproving respect for human rights, including equality between the sexes&#xd;<br />•\tencouraging a more stable economic environment in which businesses can grow and create jobs.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We will also participate in relevant consultations, such as the current consultation on the rules on the import of cultural goods.  This could be an issue important to a traditional community as a potential source of revenue, but also as a safeguard against the looting or disposal of important cultural heritage.","lastUp":"2018-06-26T18:07:11.615+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
