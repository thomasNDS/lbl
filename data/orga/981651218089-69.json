The building itself is part of Belgium’s architectural heritage. It was designed and executed by the Belgian architect Victor Horta in the 1920s. &#xd;<br />With almost 4000 m² of exhibition space, a concert hall with 2100 seats, a theatre room for 480 people, two smaller theatres, three spaces newly set up for multimedia projects, different foyers, the Centre for Fine Arts has developed into a dynamic arts centre registering more than a million visitors a year. The Centre for Fine Arts stands out as the arts centre par&#xd;<br />excellence in the cultural landscape of Belgium, host country to the European institutions.&#xd;<br />Since the reorganisation in 2002 (into a ‘Public Law Limited Liability Company with Social Purpose), all the artistic disciplines fall under only one general management. The Centre for Fine Arts is operating under the tutelary authority of the prime minister of Belgium. It stands out as a meeting place for the different communities of our country, for the many international communities that have established themselves in Belgium, and for the European Union.","acronym":"BOZAR","interests":"Communication, Culture, Education and training, External Relations, Youth","euInitiatives":"With its multidisciplinary and cross-sector programmes, the Centre for Fine Arts offers a plural experience and a guidance contributing to the spreading and knowledge of European cultures interacting with the world.  In the capital of Europe, the Centre for Fine Arts stands as a platform for cultural diplomacy.&#xd;<br />The Centre for Fine Arts wants to be a showcase where cultural Europe with its cultural heritage as well as its contemporary art forms, can be seen in all its diversity by national and international visitors. Within our activities at European Forum level, we are providing on a structural basis room for debate and discussion about the rich cultural identity of Europe and social topics.&#xd;<br />The European cultural ‘unity in diversity’ is the result of century long exchanges, individual contacts and migrations. When organizing art-historical exhibitions and multidisciplinary festivals, the Centre for Fine Arts pays especially attention to exchanges within Europe and between Europe and the world, and to the added European value of each project.  In this way, we add each time one more piece to the larger frame and throw light upon periods, regions and artists from different angles.","lastUp":"2019-07-09T11:30:43.352+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"1000000-1249999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
