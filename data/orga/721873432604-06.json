As the largest network of public theatres in Europe, the ETC has more than 40 European Member Theatres from over 20 countries, reflecting the diversity of Europe’s vibrant cultural sector. Founded in 1988, the ETC promotes European theatre as a vital platform for dialogue, democracy and interaction that responds to, reflects and engages with today’s diverse audiences and changing societies. ETC fosters an inclusive notion of theatre that brings Europe’s social, linguistic and cultural heritage to audiences and communities in Europe and beyond. Powerful and professional ETC governance ensures that the network will thrive and grow, taking into consideration the latest trends and developments. The ETC’s current four-year ENGAGE programme offers our members many opportunities and project possibilities. This comprehensive, ground-breaking programme is supported by the Creative Europe programme of the European Union.","acronym":"ETC","interests":"Culture, Education and training, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"ETC’s work is based on multiple principles in line with Creative Europe’s and the European Commission’s “Europe 2020” strategies’ key priorities: - Intercultural Artistic Programme &amp; Cultural Diversity: ETC develops innovative and transnational story-telling as well as new collaboration formats in the perspective of a diverse European repertory for drama theatres with a strong focus on young audiences, participative formats and the use of technologies. - Learning &amp; Mobility: ETC offers instruments for multilingual theatre programming in Europe to promote and serve a linguistic and culturally diverse community on a permanent basis, resources for life-long learning about and through theatre. Professional development programmes aim at strengthening peer-to-peer learning and intercultural exchange in the theatre sector. - Audience Development &amp; Access to Culture: On European level, ETC establishes audience development strategies for theatres and gathers in a comparable format data on existing and non-existing audiences to investigate and develop common patterns and evolve relations between theatres and their public across Europe. Cross-sectorial research projects examine the use of participative formats and digital technologies in order to reach out to wider and new audiences. - Digitisation &amp; Innovation: ETC incorporates and develops working methods and digital technologies as fundamental tool for theatre networking, empowers theatres to address the digital change in our society by reflecting this in artistic works as well as in a financially and environmentally responsible manner, new business models of organisational and economic structures in theatres. - Cultural Heritage: In cooperation with Opera Europa and PEARLE*, ETC created the joint campaign “On Stage 2018” celebrating the performing arts in Europe and promoting theatre as an intangible cultural heritage on the new digital platform onstage2018.eu. - Leadership: ETC takes responsibility, gives visibility to and promotes the impact of European theatres as relevant and innovative places of reflection and exchange to foster diversity, respect and tolerance.","lastUp":"2018-09-21T14:43:26.778+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
