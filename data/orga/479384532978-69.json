Research constitutes a parallel path to that formed by cooperation and alliances with the industrial system.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Knowing the world in which you are going to work is a vital requirement for training students. By referring back to the needs of the industrial world and public administration, research is facilitated in following new paths and dealing with the need for constant and rapid innovation. The alliance with the industrial world, in many cases favored by Fondazione Politecnico and by consortiums to which Politecnico belong, allows the university to follow the vocation of the territories in which it operates and to be a stimulus for their development.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The challenge which is being met today projects this tradition which is strongly rooted in the territory beyond the borders of the country, in a relationship which is developing first of all at the European level with the objective of contributing to the creation of a single professional training market. Politecnico takes part in several research, sites and training projects collaborating with the most qualified European universities. Politecnico's contribution is increasingly being extended to other countries: from North America to Southeast Asia to Eastern Europe. Today the drive to internationalization sees Politecnico Milano taking part into the European and world network of leading technical universities and it offers several courses beside many which are entirely taught in English.","acronym":"POLIMI","interests":"Agriculture, Banking and financial services, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Energy, Environment, International co-operation and development, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Politecnico di Milano is member of several European structures and platforms.","lastUp":"2018-10-31T17:03:26.273+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
