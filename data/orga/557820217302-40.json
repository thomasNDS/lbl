(Arthur W. Foshay, Educational Achievements of Thirteen-Year-Olds in Twelve Countries, 1962)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />IEA became a legal entity in 1967, but its origins date back to 1958 when a group of scholars, educational psychologists, sociologists, and psychometricians met at the UNESCO Institute for Education in Hamburg, Germany, to discuss problems of school and student evaluation. They argued that effective evaluation requires examination of both the inputs to education and its outcomes (such as knowledge, attitudes, and participation).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The founders of IEA viewed the world as a natural educational laboratory, where different school systems experiment in different ways to obtain optimal results in the education of their youth, and we still assume that if research could obtain evidence from across a wide range of systems, the variability would be sufficient to reveal important relationships, which would otherwise escape detection within a single education system. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Until today we strongly reject data-free assertions about the relative merits of various education systems, and aim in identifying factors having meaningful and consistent influences on educational outcomes.","lastUp":"2018-05-22T08:17:30.372+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"500000-599999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
