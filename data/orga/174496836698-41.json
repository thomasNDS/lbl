We have so far saved over 20 million meals to a community of 13 million Waste Warriors across 30.000 partners.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our mission is clear: we want to inspire and empower everyone to take action against food waste. Most recently we have set ambitious targets to have an even wider impact by building the Movement Against Food Waste. Our intention is to use our position as the largest global B2C food waste business to help and further reduce food waste along the supply chain.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Environment, Food Safety, Public Health, Single market, Taxation","euInitiatives":"European Green Deal&#xd;<br />Circular Economy&#xd;<br />Farm-to-fork strategy&#xd;<br />Food Waste&#xd;<br />Platforms regulation&#xd;<br />Data protection&#xd;<br />Consumer rights&#xd;<br />VAT","lastUp":"2019-12-02T09:09:07.831+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
