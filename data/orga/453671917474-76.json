Thus, beside a cultural and lobbying action, side by side with traditional associations, Salviamo l’Orso is aimed at doing, positively doing.&#xd;<br />We hope time will show we are right, and in a few years we could look at the future of our bears in a more  optimistic perspective.&#xd;<br />This is a hard struggle, it could even look like a desperate one, considering our country, Italy, being so scarcely aware of immaterial values, but  previous experiences such as the unbelievable numeric increase in bear population in Spain, or closer to us the experience with bears in Trentino demonstrated that we can work to invert this tendency, and thus we decided to try out seriously.","acronym":"SLO","interests":"Education, Environment","euInitiatives":"SLO have sent letters to the EU environment commission and will be the hosting organisation of an Erasmus plus programme with students coming from the University of Plymouth.","lastUp":"2018-04-22T10:30:01.825+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
