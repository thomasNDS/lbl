It promotes increased productivity and culture by disseminating knowledge of the latest business management techniques. Since its foundation, CPV has promoted a culture of workplace safety by running workshops and information days via its study groups, twelve organisations divided by sphere of interest. It also organises training and consultancy for local businesses as part of campaigns and initiatives funded by the Veneto Regional Government. Thanks to these study groups, freelance professionals and employers are able to provide information and training. Close links with the production industry enable the study groups to deal with current issues, but they do not carry out any trade union or commercial activity.
