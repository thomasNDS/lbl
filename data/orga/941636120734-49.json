The facts concerning wildlife crimes are truly appalling and the devastation - much of which is irreversible – that industrial-scale wildlife crime causes is truly shocking.  Wildlife crime is estimated to be one of largest transnational organized criminal activities in the world alongside trafficking in drugs, arms, and human beings. Wildlife crime is one of the biggest drivers of biodiversity loss and of climate change.  Wildlife crime destabilizes societies, enables the spread of diseases such as Ebola and Zica, fuels corruption and other types of crimes such as money laundering and terrorism.  The illegal trade in natural resources deprives developing economies of billions of dollars in lost revenues.  If the occurrences of industrial-scale wildlife crime can be considerably curtailed or even stopped, the immediate and long-term results will be truly encouraging for the health of our planet and all its life forms.","acronym":"WJC","interests":"Environment, Maritime affairs and fisheries","euInitiatives":"The main EU initiatives, policies and legislative files currently followed by the Wildlife Justice Commission are those related to wildlife crimes and related subjects (for instance, biodiversity, nature conservation and ecosystems.)&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In particular, the Wildlife Justice Commission follows the EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking and The EU Biodiversity for Life (B4Life) Flagship Initiative.
