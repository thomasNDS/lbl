The creation of a European Chamber of Commerce in Myanmar reinforces the mutually beneficial relationship between the EU and the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. The European Union was in fact one of the first actors to respond to the country's political opening, suspending in April 2012 its restrictive measures except for the arms embargo.&#xd;<br />EuroCham Myanmar serves as the voice of European business in Myanmar. Its main mission is to advocate member interests with organisations in Myanmar, the ASEAN region and the EU.&#xd;<br />EuroCham seeks to offer on the ground assistance to European businesses interested in commercial endeavours in Myanmar – be it in the form of advocacy, services, studies, or other related activities.","acronym":"EuroCham Myanmar","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Banking and financial services, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Consumers, Customs, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"Activities related to the promotion of trade and investment with Myanmar.
