We come together under a common vision of a democratic, diverse and borderless Europe.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We come together in AEGEE to form an open, voluntary network where we transform our ideas into actions, develop ourselves to participate actively in society, and contribute to the European debate with our independent student’s perspective.&#xd;<br />We hereby declare these principles to be fundamental to us:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The diversity of Europe has to be valued,and we reflect it in our organisation. The richness of our continent relies on people from different cultures and backgrounds coming together and being united by common values.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Cooperation between people and communities begins with dialogue and mutual understanding. We bring together students from all regions of Europe and create friendships that break stereotypes and prejudices.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Freedom and human rights are essential elements of a European society. Through our work and behaviour, we aim to serve as an example and spread these values among the youth of our continent.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />A strong Europe is built upon the foundations of respect, tolerance and solidarity. Following these values, we stand for an inclusive society where citizens enjoy equal opportunities and rights.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Progress in Europe has to be based on knowledge and unlimited access to education. By providing diverse learning opportunities and supporting a European dimension in education, we believe it gives young people better opportunities for the future.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />By honoring and promoting these principles we shape a better Europe.","lastUp":"2018-08-16T12:39:20.586+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
