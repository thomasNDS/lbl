The Association was created to provide a sustainable future for the European Chemistry Thematic Network.&#xd;<br />Higher education institutions, national chemical societies and chemical and software companies comprise our members. There are currently over 120 members of the network coming from 30 different European countries and with associate members world-wide.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Expert European groups work on a range of topics and produce reports with a real European dimension. These reports and recommendations are available on our website.&#xd;<br />The ECTN is responsible for European quality labels for chemistry programmes at the bachelor, master and doctorate level, the chemistry Eurobachelor, Euromaster, and the Chemistry Doctorate Eurolabel.&#xd;<br />A multi-lingual series of tests, that can be used for certification / validation of competence in chemistry at various levels is now available on Internet. Associated E-learning facilities have been produced. The purpose of the tests is to validate the competence of all citizens, irrespective of their learning path.","acronym":"ECTN","interests":"Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Research and innovation, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"The ECTN has been actively involved in many projects funded by the European Commission under the Erasmus and Leonardo de Vinci programmes.
