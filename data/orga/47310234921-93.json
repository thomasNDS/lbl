The observatory offers different services in French, English and Spanish as well as other languages, addressed to entities, professionals and individuals from all over the world involved and interested in the subject. It seeks to be rigorous and independent in its work, its reflections and its proposals concerning Juvenile Justice, as well as minors and young people in social difficulties, with behavioural problems or in conflict with the law.&#xd;<br />The focus of the work undertaken by the International Juvenile Justice Observatory centres on issues relating to minors and young people in conflict with the law. The political, legislative, police-related, socio-educational and scientific responses developed in each country should be concrete and applicable. The main objective established is the development of minors and young people so they can acquire the skills they need to become free citizens outside the circuits of exclusion and reclusion.&#xd;<br />The international phenomenon of juvenile delinquency and, as a consequence, the evolution of juvenile justice should be studied and analysed from a global perspective taking into account the plurality of situations worldwide. From these official reports, the International Juvenile Justice Observatory generates impartial proposals for change taking into account economic, political, social and legal policies, the objective being to favour the harmonisation of policies affecting juveniles and young offenders.&#xd;<br />The mission of the International Juvenile Justice Observatory is to bring an international and inter-disciplinary vision of juvenile justice in order to create a future for minors and young people all over the world who are in situations of exclusion leading to infringements of the law. It promotes international development strategies of appropriate policies, legislations and intervention methods within the context of a global juvenile justice without borders. The IJJO agrees to promote and work respecting the following international texts:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />    Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On December 10, 1948 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&#xd;<br />    The Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly within the framework of its resolution 44/25 of 20 November 1989.&#xd;<br />    United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (The Riyadh Guidelines).&#xd;<br />    United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (The Beijing Rules).&#xd;<br />    United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial Measures (The Tokyo Rules).&#xd;<br />    General Comment No 10(2007). Children's Rights in Juvenile Justice issued by the Committee on the Rights of the Child.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />These rules, as well as the Convention, represent the will of the international community, expressed by the recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly on Children of 2002 \"A world fit for children\".","acronym":"IJJO","interests":"Education, Employment and Social Affairs, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Youth","euInitiatives":"The IJJO has participated in various consultation processes carried out within the EU institutions, providing its expertise in issues related to juvenile justice, protection of the rights of the child and crime prevention.&#xd;<br />Through its participation in these processes, the IJJO demonstrates its full commitment to defending the Rights of the Child, especially in relation to children in conflict with the law, and contributes to a juvenile justice without borders and the promotion of alternative measures to liberty deprivation.&#xd;<br />IJJO contributions include:&#xd;<br />\tCollaboration on the Green Paper ‘Strengthening mutual trust in the European judicial area - A Green Paper on the application of EU criminal justice legislation in the field of detention’ (DG Justice).&#xd;<br />\tConsultation on the EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child (EEAS).&#xd;<br />\tConsultation on the 2012 Recommendation on Child Poverty (DG Employment). &#xd;<br />\tContribution to the public consultation on the Communication ‘Towards a stronger European response to drugs’ (DG Justice).&#xd;<br />\tContribution to the 2012 report on the follow-up of the 2008 Recommendation on Active Inclusion (DG Employment). &#xd;<br />\tConsultation for the Coalition to make the Internet a better place for kids (DG Information Society and Media).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In addition, the IJJO has issued a series of Green Papers on Child-Friendly Justice and a White Paper. The content of these papers was taken into consideration for the drafting of the European Commission Green Paper on detention:&#xd;<br />\tGreen Paper of the ECJJ Public Administration Section: ‘Evaluation of the Implementation of International Standards in National Juvenile Justice Systems.’&#xd;<br />\tGreen Paper of the ECJJ Academic Section: ‘Measures of Deprivation of Liberty for young offenders: how to enrich International Standards in Juvenile Justice and promote alternatives to detention’ &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />- Green Paper of the ECJJ NGO Section: ‘The Social Reintegration of Young Offenders as a Key Against Recidivism’&#xd;<br />- White Paper of the ECJJ ´Save Money, Protect Society and Realise Youth Potential. Improving Juvenile Justice Systems during a time of economic crisis´.&#xd;<br />In order to foster a an EU-wide common position to protect the rights and well-being of young people and promote a child-friendly justice system, the IJJO has issued a set of recommendations and proposals to the European Commission on ‘Minimum standards in pre-trial detention procedures.’ The report focuses on the need to improve pre-trial detention conditions for young offenders through educational, training and work&#xd;<br />programmes, in order to ensure their comprehensive development. The IJJO is also in favour of separation between adults and children in pre-trial detention and considers that it is crucial to ensure these children receive legal assistance. The IJJO is currently working on a White paper to Improve juvenile justice systems and to make them more efficient and child-friendly, in particular  regarding the communication with the child and the rights of the child to be heard in criminal proceedings, and contribute like this to a better implementation of the Directive 2016/800/EU.","lastUp":"2018-04-04T16:35:52.211+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
