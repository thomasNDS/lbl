There are 17,000 solicitors practising in the \"Square Mile\", who account for 15% of the profession in England and Wales, represented by the CLLS through individual and corporate membership. The CLLS was originally part of the City of London Solicitors' Company which was founded in 1908, but in 1969 a separate Committee structure was set up to deal with all professional business and since 1986 this has been known as the City of London Law Society.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Following the introduction of Corporate Membership of the Society in 2006, which allowed firms to have individual membership for all of their solicitors practising from their City of London offices, the membership of the CLLS has increased significantly and now includes over two thirds of the solicitors practising in the City of London.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In 2007 the City of London Law Society formally separated from the City of London Solicitors' Company to become a freestanding local Law Society, confirming its position as the professional representative body for solicitors and law firms in the City.","acronym":"CLLS","interests":"Banking and financial services, Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Competition, Consumers, Customs, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport","euInitiatives":"The CLLS's specialist Committees also consider and, where appropriate, draft representations on, a number of areas of EU legal policy as they relate to their specific areas.
