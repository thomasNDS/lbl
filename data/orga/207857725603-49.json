Strong IP protection must be a pillar of the digital-based economy, but such protections must be balanced to take into account the legitimate interests and rights of patent holders to be fairly rewarded and the public’s interest in fuelling investment in new technologies. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As part of that mission, we raise awareness about the imbalances in Europe’s patent legal system and how they are exploited to the detriment of Europe’s innovators, as shown by the rise of Patent Assertion Entities’ (PAEs) in Europe. We work with policymakers, the legal profession and judicial authorities to address these imbalances in order to protect the integrity of the patent legal system in Europe and support its goal of innovation.","acronym":"IP2I","interests":"Business and Industry, Competition, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Energy, Environment, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and innovation, Single market, Transport","euInitiatives":"IP package&#xd;<br />UPC agreement&#xd;<br />Digital Single Market&#xd;<br />Single Market&#xd;<br />Internet of Things (IoT)&#xd;<br />Artificial Intelligence","lastUp":"2020-01-10T09:46:56.440+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
