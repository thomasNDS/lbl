This includes all the main UN agencies that deal with water as well as at the European level all the relevant EU agencies and administrations.&#xd;<br />- To contribute, in a constructive manner, and by co-operating with other stakeholders, to solving the world’s water problems by sharing the expertise of private operators and working with the international community, including the UN system and the EU bodies, and intergovernmental initiatives. As such we are an accredited ‘Friend of UN-Water’ and  share completely UN-Water's second goal, which is “to contribute substantially to the achievements of global water and sanitation related targets and goals” with an “emphasis on MDGs and JPOI”. In addition, AquaFed has been a member of the EUWI steering group.&#xd;<br />- To ensure that the various ways of involving the private sector in delivering water and sanitation services to users are properly understood and evaluated so that national and local governments can choose the public or private management option that suits their individual needs best on a case-by-case basis.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />It is important to note that AquaFed is not a commercial organisation. It does not claim that private management of water services is better than public management and publicly acknowledges the existence of well-run water systems in both cases. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AquaFed’s objective is to find solutions to solving water issues with all contributing stakeholders including governments, institutions, labour and customer representatives, NGOs, public &amp; private water professionals.","acronym":"AquaFed","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, Institutional affairs, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Taxation, Trade, Youth","euInitiatives":"follow-up of the Concessions Directive impact&#xd;<br />revision of the Drinking Water and Wastewater Framework Directives&#xd;<br />Trade Agreements&#xd;<br />Environmental policy&#xd;<br />Internal Market&#xd;<br />European Citizens Initiative&#xd;<br />Human rights&#xd;<br />International development policy","lastUp":"2019-05-10T10:15:16.493+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
