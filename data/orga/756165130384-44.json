Newly arrived migrants, including refugees, face a multitude of challenges integrating into new host societies and labour markets. While policies and funding are being directed towards the problem, we have identified a clear gap and opportunity to deliver an innovative scalable approach to facilitating labour market integration. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our activities are focused on leveraging mobile technology that migrants already have access to and use actively to create comprehensive skills maps and link those to European skills and competency frameworks. Too often understanding where one’s professional experience and skills fit in local labor markets is an arduous process that involves mundane and bureaucratic data collection mechanisms that are too inflexible to effectively capture an individual’s skill offering. Furthermore, that data that is collected rarely yields a coherent and transparent picture of how an individual fits into the local labour market and where they should direct their upskilling efforts to be competitive. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our early activities centre around intimately understanding the challenges that migrants face from a personal perspective to design an empowering application that assesses an individual’s skills and link these to an underlying skills/competency framework based on ESCO, and provide migrants with a highly tailored, personalised picture of employment opportunities and optimised skill-building recommendations linked to local vocational education institutions.","acronym":"","interests":"Borders and Security, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, External Relations, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy","euInitiatives":"Skilllab follows a range of EU initiatives related to immigration, asylum, refugees and the integration of third country nationals.
