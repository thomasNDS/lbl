This can result in the loss of democracy in EU decision-making and the postponement, weakening, or rejection of urgently needed progress on social, environmental and consumer-protection reforms.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ALTER-EU is committed to transparency about EU interest representation. ALTER-EU believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide EU lobbying transparency. When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU.
