It has a place – but is not the mainstay of informed opinion or understanding of turns of events.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Say&#xd;<br />It is becoming ever-more evident, we say, that quality journalism is dependent on real news gathering – especially when reporters, photographers and video-journalists are able to provide witness accounts on the ground at events, including sports tournaments.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Urge&#xd;<br />In the interests of the public right to know and real news viability we urge the public, sporting and other news events and their commercial partners, and governments to value news. Commercial and societal values must be factored into assessing what drives individual interest and brand exposure.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Convinced&#xd;<br />We are convinced news organisations that are trusted, have market reach, have a pattern of investment in independent news coverage (NMC Members) must be given the best opportunities to run news operations in and around organised events of public interest – and for such opportunities to grow to match informational evolution.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Target&#xd;<br />Our News Media Coalition target is to secure news content and business freedoms for members, the news-consuming public and future generations – and to do so single-mindedly but also in collaboration with the subjects of news, event organisations and public policy makers who recognise the importance of the news sector.","acronym":"NMC","interests":"Communication, Competition, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Sport","euInitiatives":"News Media&#xd;<br />News Gathering &#xd;<br />Copyright&#xd;<br />Sport&#xd;<br />Competition&#xd;<br />Digital Piracy&#xd;<br />Integrity","lastUp":"2019-02-14T10:48:20.985+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"400000-499999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
