Its up to 50 eminent members from around the globe have already successfully promoted change. The Council addresses challenges to our common future and provides decision makers with effective policy solutions. In-depth research underpins advocacy work for international agreements, regional policy frameworks and national lawmaking and thus produces practical and tangible results. In close collaboration with civil society actors, parliamentarians, governments, business and international organizations, we identify future just policies around the globe. The results of this research then feed into our advocacy work, supporting decision makers in implementing those policies. The World Future Council is registered as a charitable foundation in Hamburg, Germany. Our work is not possible without continuous financial support from private and institutional donors.
