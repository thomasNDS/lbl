The combination of our tools and our users is a vast and growing digital commons, a pool of content that can be copied, distributed, edited, remixed, and built upon, all within the boundaries of copyright law. We’ve worked with copyright experts around the world to make sure our licenses are legally solid, globally applicable, and responsive to our users’ needs.","acronym":"CC","interests":"Communication, Culture, Culture and media, Digital economy and society, Education and training, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Trade, Trans-European Networks","euInitiatives":"Legal Aspects of Public Sector Information (LAPSI)&#xd;<br />Review of EU copyright rules (copyright consultation)&#xd;<br />Opening Up Education&#xd;<br />OHIM&#xd;<br />Horizon 2020","lastUp":"2018-10-31T16:17:03.464+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"0-9999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
