Our goal is to promote European strategies for an all-inclusive low carbon energy policy that is based on scientific and factual information and can lead to a reduction in GHG emissions in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement, i.e. to global temperature rise not exceeding 1.5C.  We believe that this can be achieved through a mixture of energy savings and the use of various low-carbon energy sources - for example hydro, wind, solar, and nuclear energy - provided that energy security and social sustainability is maintained at an affordable price.","acronym":"weCARE","interests":"Climate Action, Competition, Education and training, Energy, Environment, Institutional affairs, Research and innovation, Single market, Transport","euInitiatives":"Energy and climate policy, carbon price, energy market design, energy economics, energy research &amp; development, electrification, transmission &amp; distribution, investment and funding schemes","lastUp":"2019-07-17T17:22:32.424+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
