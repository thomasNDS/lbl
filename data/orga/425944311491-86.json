As an organization of producers, defined in the settlement (CE) n°104/2000 of the Council, its main aims are:&#xd;<br />- to improve the conditions of sale of the production of its members,&#xd;<br />- to encourage responsible and sustainable fishing methods,&#xd;<br />- to contribute to the capture and fishing effort quota management,&#xd;<br />- and to represent, defend and promote the general interests of Tropical Tuna fishing ship-owners (especially towards the French public authorities and community organizations, regional fisheries management organizations and sectorial organizations, both national or international).&#xd;<br />ORTHONGEL and its member ship-owners are particularly attached to good governance. This results in our regular participation to meetings (plenary and scientific) of RFMOs, in our close cooperation with scientists related to the provision of data or research programs, in a dialog and even cooperation with NGOs that want to get involved in the sector to improve best practices and, finally, in ORTHONGEL's implication in organizations that contribute to the sustainable management of stocks or that promote good environmental and social practices.","acronym":"ORTHONGEL","interests":"Maritime affairs and fisheries","euInitiatives":"Reform of the external dimension of the CFP&#xd;<br />FAR regulation &#xd;<br />Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements&#xd;<br />RFMOs' regulations","lastUp":"2019-12-12T11:25:19.233+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"500000-599999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
