More than 10 million people are employed directly by the industry whilst the sector supports around 16.6m jobs, representing 7.8% of the European workforce or one in every 13 jobs in Europe. The overall turnover is more than 1 trillion Euros (gross value added of more than 460 billion Euros), equaling over 8% of total European economic output and 3.7% of GDP&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The Asian-European Hospitality industry faces all the same regulatory obstacles and compliance challenges as the rest of the sector, whilst at the same time dealing with a set of specific problems, such as the difficulties in getting highly qualified Asian chefs to Europe to implement their unique cooking styles in the many high-quality Asian restaurants, spread across the EU. Based on the successful model of the UK Asian Catering Federation, the AHFE brings together likeminded associations of Asian hospitality businesses from across the continent and the UK, to join forces and lobby for a better regulatory framework.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />It is our goal to foster better regulation for the entire industry, by creating a healthy regulatory framework in which the Asian-European hospitality industry can flourish. At the same time AHFE serves as a platform for business to business relations, bringing together Asian-European entrepreneurs. Lastly, AHFE celebrates outstanding quality in the Asian-European Hospitality Industry, by means of the annual European Asian Restaurant Awards.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The association is led by its President Yawar Khan (UK), with its secretariat based in Brussels, in the heart of the EU area, at a stoneâ€™s throw from the European Parliament. serves as a platform for business to business relationships, bringing together Asian-European entrepreneurs.","acronym":"AHFE","interests":"Business and Industry, Consumers, Culture, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Environment, Food Safety, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Public Health, Single market, Taxation, Trade","euInitiatives":"Skills and growth, Visa proposals, Digital Single Market files, food safety","lastUp":"2019-02-25T11:17:14.171+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
