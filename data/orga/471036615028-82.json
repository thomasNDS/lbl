Its network spans national borders across Europe and the wider world with the aim of promoting the best progressive thinking on the major social and economic challenges of the 21st century. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our work is driven by a network of politicians, policymakers, business leaders, public service professionals, and academic researchers who work on long-term issues relating to public policy, political economy, social attitudes, governance and international affairs. This is complemented by the expertise and research excellence of Policy Network’s international team.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Policy Network sets out to rigorously analyse the structural changes facing the advanced democracies, and to facilitate ideas and policy solutions to complex governance challenges. Inherent in our approach is a focus on drawing out the tension between policy ideas and the practical impediments to their implementation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The network-building side of Policy Network seeks to form intellectual consensus behind these ideas and facilitate dynamic platforms for international exchange, ideas dissemination and political reflection. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />A platform of research and ideas:&#xd;<br />- Promoting expert ideas and political analysis on the key economic, social and political challenges of our age.&#xd;<br />- Disseminating research excellence and relevant knowledge to a wider public audience through interactive policy networks, including interdisciplinary and scholarly collaboration.&#xd;<br />- Engaging and informing the public debate about the future of European and global progressive politics.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />A network of leaders, policymakers and thinkers:&#xd;<br />- Building international policy communities comprising individuals and affiliate institutions.&#xd;<br />- Providing meeting platforms where the politically active, and potential leaders of the future, can engage with each other across national borders and with the best thinkers who are sympathetic to their broad aims.&#xd;<br />- Engaging in external collaboration with partners including higher education institutions, the private sector, thinktanks, charities, community organisations, and trade unions.&#xd;<br />- Delivering an innovative events programme combining in-house seminars with large-scale public conferences designed to influence and contribute to key public debates.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In addition, the structure of Policy Network is tailored towards generating significant charitable and private sector sponsorship of core activities, including events, conferences and publications.
