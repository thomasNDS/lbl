Soon thereafter, the OUNLâ€™s Educational Expertise Centre was commissioned by the Ministry of Education to provide an innovative stimulus to Dutch Higher Education by carrying out research and development work on technology enhanced learning. One of its results has been the development of an educational modelling language (EML), which in a slightly modified form was adopted by the IMS consortium as one of its specifications (IMS Learning Design). IMS LD is a language for modelling learning scenarios of any kind in machine readable, portable ways. &#xd;<br />The OU is active in the following EU programs:&#xd;<br />Erasmus+&#xd;<br />Horizon 2020&#xd;<br />Opening up education","lastUp":"2020-01-06T10:18:04.499+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
