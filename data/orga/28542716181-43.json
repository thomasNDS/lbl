The principal grades produced by ETS members are toilet tissue, household towels, facial tissue, hankies and industrial towels and wipes. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The tissue industry is a \"Fast Moving Consumer Goods\" industry. Tissue products have very specific characteristics, all of which contribute to enhancing the users' hygiene and comfort. In order to meet customer expectations and to remain a successful industry, the tissue industry also needs continuous innovation and development. The role of ETS in this respect is to serve the industry by assisting in the management of many non-competitive issues, such as regulatory changes, and by maintaining relationships with external stakeholders such as authorities and consumer groups. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ETS is currently working with its members on a number of sustainability initiatives and these efforts will undoubtedly be continued in the future.&#xd;<br />Copyright © 2000–2011 European Tissue Symposium","acronym":"ETS","interests":"Climate Action, Consumer Affairs, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, Food Safety, Public Health","euInitiatives":"Consumer products regulation; environmental and chemicals regulation and policies; hygiene and safety policies; forestry products regulation and policies; regulations on food contact materials.","lastUp":"2017-08-29T15:55:05.072+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"25000-49999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
