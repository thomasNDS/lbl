The retailers can, but do not always operate under the same brand name. Other models are service providers which enable independent retailers to be competitive in the market.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Independent Retail Europe represents a very large part of the retail market: over 380,000 independent retailers, who manage more than 757,000 sales outlets in all EU Member States. This represents a total employment of more than 6,480,000 persons.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Independent Retail Europe is the oldest and second largest European retail association in Brussels.","acronym":"","interests":"Business and Industry, Competition, Consumers, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Food Safety, Institutional affairs, Single market, Taxation","euInitiatives":"Our priorities are defined by the business model of independent retailers working in a group structure and the sector.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Competition rules&#xd;<br />As the central organisation of the group acts at a different economic level of the chain compared to the independent retailers, certain types of vertical agreements between the central organisation and the retailers are indispensible to the efficient functioning of these groups. Agreements can include information exchanges, purchasing agreements, agreements on commercialisation and standardisation.They have pro-competitive effects, which benefit consumers. Meanwhile, on a horizontal level, the retailers of the same group always remain independent entrepreneurs and competitors. Due to this dual structure, agreements between groups of independent retailers are subject to the vertical competition Regulation and guidelines but can also be subject to horizontal competition guidelines. We seek to heighten competition and consumer benefit whilst creating an optimal competitive playing field for our members.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Digital and Single Market Strategy&#xd;<br />Our members are active multi-channel retailers. We seek to ensure that EU policy respects a fair playing field for all retail channels and that groups of independent retailers and their members can efficiently operate on and offline, and are able to compete on fair terms. Issues: Level playing field for on- and offline, geoblocking, platforms, parcel delivery, VAT, consumer rights, copying levies etc &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Entrepreneurship&#xd;<br />One way in which independent/SME retail entrepreneurs can reach their full potential whilst remaining independent is by joining a group of independent retailers. Therefore, we work on achieving political recognition for the group business model for independent/SME retail, as a promoter of entrepreneurship and sustainable growth. Related issues: cooperative business model, fair taxation, insolvency.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />SME policy&#xd;<br />Our member groups are composed of, or provide services to, independent SME retailers. Involvement in SME policy discussions are therefore a priority, to ensure that the interests of independent SME retailers are taken into consideration. SME financing.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />European Retail Action Plan &#xd;<br />In its European Retail Action Plan, the European Commission acknowledges the importance of our groups in the EU retail market. We seek to ensure that the actions contained in the plan benefit, and reflect the needs of, groups of independent retailers. Market diversity, healthy cities and private labels are related issues of importance.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />B2B trading practices &#xd;<br />Our members operate on wholesale and retail level and will be affected by the policy outcomes of discussions related to supply chain behaviour. We are a founder of the Supply Chain Initiative, a voluntary framework that seeks to ensure fair behaviour between different sectors in the food supply chain.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Product safety and labelling &#xd;<br />Our members are deeply committed to ensuring that only safe products are on the market. This is essential for their relationships with customers and their reputation. In order to achieve clear, understandable rules that can easily be implemented and do not constitute an unnecessary burden on SME retailers, we work on the clarification of the obligations of economic actors – especially of distributors. Equally, we seek to avoid unnecessary burdens created by changes to the labelling rules.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Food safety and labelling&#xd;<br />We have many members active in food retail. Our members believe that it is essential to ensure safe supply chains and high levels of consumer welfare. As such we are active on all food safety issues, particularly with regard to distributors obligations. We seek to avoid unnecessary burdens for SME retailers created by changes to the labelling rules.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Circular economy&#xd;<br />Retailers work with many linked sectors and complex supply chains. As such we follow EU policy on the circular economy, waste and food waste, energy and resource efficiency, etc","lastUp":"2019-12-06T10:59:44.012+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
