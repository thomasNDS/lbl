Saving lives and reducing suffering&#xd;<br />ii. Maintaining the dignity of affected communities during and in the aftermath of disasters&#xd;<br />iii. Strengthening community preparedness for future disasters&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Concern is known as an innovative and influential organisation in tackling hunger globally by:&#xd;<br />i. Designing and managing innovative and high quality programmes to achieve food and nutrition security, especially those adaptive to climate change.&#xd;<br />ii. Building resilience to food and nutrition crises in fragile contexts.&#xd;<br />iii. Influencing global, regional and national policies and implementation mechanisms that drive structural changes to achieve food and nutrition security for the poorest people.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our core focus is on extreme poverty and humanitarian response working in the sectors of Livelihoods, Health, Education and Emergency response. In all of our work, we engage in:&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />1. ‘On-the-ground’ work. Engaging with communities, we work with governments, civil society partners and also through direct implementation of programmes, particularly in emergencies. Building local capacity remains an important objective of Concern’s work and working in partnership with local institutions is a means of reaching that objective. We will retain a country presence and an effective, grounded connection with extremely poor people.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />2. Influencing for policy change. Our mission statement commits us to address the root causes of the poverty of our target group. Focusing on the issues most pertinent to our work, we derive evidence from our operational programmes to persuade, engage and encourage public and political support for the adoption of pro-poor policies and practices we know to be effective.","acronym":"","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Education and training, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Public Health","euInitiatives":"Post-2015 programme work with Alliance2015&#xd;<br />EU Consensus (on both Development and Humanitarian Aid)&#xd;<br />EU Food Security Policy Framework&#xd;<br />EU Nutrition Action Plan&#xd;<br />EU Resilience Action Plan&#xd;<br />MFF&#xd;<br />COHAFA","lastUp":"2019-07-24T13:28:56.603+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"10000-24999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
