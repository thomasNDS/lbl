Together with organisations of Beweging.net and MOC, WSM reinforces networks of social movements in Belgium, Africa, Latin America and Asia in order to internationalise their joint struggle at local, national, regional and international level.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />WSM and its network are working for inclusive and sustainable development. What does this imply? &#xd;<br />-\tDevelopment must be understood in its broader sense of building societies. It is clear that in the process of building societies, several possible paths can be followed. As NGO of the Christian Workers Movement, our path is towards a society with greater social justice and solidarity (and thus reduced poverty, social exclusion, inequality, and vulnerability). Development cooperation is one of the ways to contribute to building societies.&#xd;<br />-\tThis development must be inclusive: The main powers (political, economic and social powers) must act together while acknowledging their respective roles. Together they must define how they build society and where their responsibilities lie in this process.&#xd;<br />-\tThis development must also be sustainable: social, economic and environmental development must go hand in hand.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />WSM and its network can contribute to this inclusive and sustainable development on condition that social movements constitute a genuine social power able to interact efficiently with political and economic powers. Social movements are indeed a force of change, a force of social change for the community, for the society. A force which starts from and builds on the roots (bottom-up).&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />To successfully achieve such a development, Beweging.net and MOC as well as its constituent organisations firmly believe that decent work strategies must be implemented. The concept of decent work was launched and is actively promoted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and is based on 4 pillars: a productive and freely chosen employment (1) for which international labour rights (including fundamental labour standards) are respected (2), which provides access to social protection (3) and where the workers' voices are heard through social dialogue (4).","acronym":"WSM","interests":"Employment and Social Affairs, External Relations, International co-operation and development, Trade","euInitiatives":"We have been actively following and contributing to the European Communication on Decent Work (2006/2010), on Social Protection in EU Development Cooperation (2012) and the role of Civil society in Development Cooperation (2012). We also closely follow up the contribution of the EU institutions to the implementation of the Agenda 2030, mainly from our thematic expertise: decent work and the right to social protection.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Recently, WSM has taken a very active interest in the issue of human rights due diligence and how to bring this within EU initiatives, policies and legisaltive files. As a result, WSM has contributed to the deliberations and negotiations of the EU Directive on Non-Financial Reporting (2014/95/EU) and the Conflict Minerals Regulation (2016). &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />In the European Parliament, we have actively worked together with MEP's on human rights resolutions condemning labour rights violations in several countries worldwide. We have also contributed to the drafting of Parliamentary Reports and questions of MEP's for EC Commissioners on issues relevant to our work in the field of labour rights and social protection. in 2017, WSM contributed to the EP Report on the impact of international trade and the EU’s trade policies on global value chains.","lastUp":"2019-09-27T11:58:56.005+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
