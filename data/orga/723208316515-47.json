To do this, we identify projects with especially strong potential to bring about social change. We start with a quality assessment process that we developed with experts in the field, identifying sectors to focus on and closely scrutinizing relevant non-profit organisations and their projects. When we find an approach that we feel is especially promising, we award it with the PHINEO impact-label.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As a not-for-profit corporation, PHINEO is supported by a broad alliance of business and civil society organisations. Together, we strengthen the non-profit sector.","acronym":"","interests":"Climate Action, Consumers, Culture, Digital economy and society, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Environment, Foreign affairs and security policy, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Migration and asylum, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Sport, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Youth","euInitiatives":"support of civic engagement for the purpose of common welfare; capacity building in terms of impact investing","lastUp":"2019-07-17T15:17:33.392+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
