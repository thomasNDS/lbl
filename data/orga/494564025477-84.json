The biennial survey on supply and sanitation services is a valuable benchmarking tool at sector and country level. The technical meetings are the best possible forum for knowledge and information exchange.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AEAS has established Technical Commissions and Working Groups that provide support, develop studies, reports and proposals on the different areas of urban water cycle: abstraction and water treatment engineering; quality and water treatment; distribution networks; urban drainage and sewerage; waste water treatment; management and commercial relations; economics and statistics; RDI; CSR.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />AEAS works in close cooperation with EurEau and other international associations such as IWA, OECD (being member of the Steering Committee of the OECD Water Governance Initiative) and Latin- American associations.","acronym":"AEAS","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Climate Action, Energy, Environment, Research and innovation","euInitiatives":"-\tCircular Economy &#xd;<br />• EU Initiative on water reuse, participating in the drafting of:&#xd;<br />* CIS Guidance on Integrating Water Reuse in Water Planning and Management&#xd;<br />* Minimum quality requirements for water reuse in irrigation and aquifer recharge - Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on mínimum requirements for water reuse&#xd;<br />• Fertiliser Regulation&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tBiocides regulation&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tDG Environment and DG Agriculture Task Force on Water and Agriculture&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tRevision of Drinking Water Directive&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tReview of the Water Framework Directive&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-      Revision of Urban Waste Water Directive&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tPriority Substances – micropollutants&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-\tEndocrine Disruptors Initiative&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />-       Horizon Europe","lastUp":"2020-01-07T14:07:38.698+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
