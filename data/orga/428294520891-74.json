The organisation was created to serve as a support mechanism for informal consultations, and to provide expertise and efficient services in the newly emerging landscape of multilateral cooperation on migration and asylum issues.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ICMPD Today&#xd;<br />ICMPD is an international organisation with 17 Member States (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey), almost 300 staff members, a mission in Brussels, and regional offices and representatives throughout Europe, Northern Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. ICMPD receives funding from its Member States, the European Commission, the UN and other multilateral institutions, as well as bilateral donors. ICMPD holds UN observer status.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our Purpose&#xd;<br />The purpose of ICMPD is to make migration and mobility of people orderly, safe and regular, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies. It strives for being a sober and neutral companion in this context, by bringing all important players around the table to discuss about migration. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ICMPD has vast experience in bridging the gap between theory and practice. Accordingly, ICMPD provides policy makers and politicians with the necessary groundwork to take decisions. Furthermore, ICMPD is present on the ground, with its capacity building activities in various areas of migration management.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our Mandate&#xd;<br />The Agreement on the Establishment and Functioning of ICMPD mentions, as a priority goal of the Member States, the development and implementation of long-term strategies to cope with the migration phenomenon, hence promoting international cooperation in the area of migration policies, as well as producing relevant research in such areas as border management and security, asylum and international protection, and migration and development. Through an approach based on a combination of research, capacity building and migration dialogue, ICMPD analyses current and potential migratory flows to European receiving countries, follows and examines the situation in the major countries of origin of migrants, develops measures to address root causes of migration, and develops an improved recognition and control of migratory movements. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />The tasks of the organisation are regularly analysed and adjusted by its Steering Group in line with the evolving policy environment and migratory trends. Relevant decisions are reflected in strategy documents approved by the Steering Group as well as yearly work programmes and budgets.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Where We Work&#xd;<br />ICMPD is a European organisation that deals with the global phenomenon of migration. Europe is more than a geographic location â€“ it embraces principles and values that guide ICMPD's work. European migration governance is built upon strong rule of law principles and the effective protection of human and fundamental rights with a long-standing humanitarian tradition. It stands for multilateralism and a partnership approach. With these principles at the basis of its approach, ICMPD operates internationally, and especially in Africa and Central Asia.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />ICMPD's geographic priorities are set in accordance with the strategic and operational objectives of its Member States and partners. Moreover, ICMPD applies the principles of partnership on an equal footing with a forward-looking orientation and a balancing of interests at national, European and global levels.","acronym":"ICMPD","interests":"Enlargement, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs","euInitiatives":"-\tEuropean Agenda for Migration&#xd;<br />-\tEU Global Approach to Migration and Mobility (GAMM), notably the dialogue with third countries as a follow-up to the Valletta Summit&#xd;<br />-\tDevelopment of the EU Global Strategy&#xd;<br />-\tEU-India Cooperation Dialogue on Migration and Mobility&#xd;<br />-\tEC proposals in the area of forced displacement and development&#xd;<br />-\tReform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), notably the review of the Dublin system, relocation and solidarity among EU MS&#xd;<br />-\tEU Action Plan on Return","lastUp":"2018-08-21T12:58:32.242+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"300000-399999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
