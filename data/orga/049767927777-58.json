Greek Carers Network “EPIONI” works to ensure that care is valued and unpaid care is recognized as central to the sustainability of health and long-term care system. We believe that carers’ expertise and needs are worth listening to and people should have the right to choose freely whether they want to be a carer, and to what extent they want to be involved in caring. Our aim is therefore to act as a voice for informal carers in Greece, irrespective of their age or the particular health need of the person they are caring for by:&#xd;<br />Documenting and raising awareness about the significant contribution made by carers to health and social care system and the economy as a whole, and of the need to safeguard this contribution;&#xd;<br />Ensuring that national policies take account of carers, i.e. promote their social inclusion, the development of support services, enable them to remain active in paid employment and maintain a social life.","acronym":"EPIONI","interests":"Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs","euInitiatives":"At EU level, the European Parliament has supported direct references to carers under the EU’s EaSI&#xd;<br />programme budget lines since 2011; &#xd;<br />The European Parliament Interest Group on Carers is continuing to act as a forum for discussion on EU policy, assessing the impact of EU policy developments on carers.&#xd;<br />In 2107, two proposals on the table that concern EPIONI: The European Social Pillar and Work/Life balance initiative.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />As far as the European Commission is concerned, several recent and major initiatives refer explicitly to&#xd;<br />carers, i.e.:&#xd;<br /> The European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing: this Partnership explicitly targets carers as one of the main stakeholder groups;&#xd;<br /> The Employment Package, more notably the Staff Working Document on the employment potential of household and personal services, which contains a number of relevant statistics on carers and the need to ensure high quality and sustainable care provision;&#xd;<br /> The Social Investment Package and its Staff Working Document on Long Term Care explicitly&#xd;<br />recognise the huge contribution of carers and acknowledges their main issues and challenges;&#xd;<br /> The SPC report on “Adequate social protection against Long-term Care risks” states that there are solid equity and efficiency reasons for Member States to support to informal carers, including through a better recognition of care duties in labour law and corporate practice;","lastUp":"2019-10-21T11:30:57.462+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
