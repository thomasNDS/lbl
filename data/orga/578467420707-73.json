ECES promotes sustainable democratic development through the provision of advisory services, operational support and management of projects and large basket funds in favour of electoral processes. ECES works with all electoral stakeholders, including electoral management bodies, civil society organizations involved in civic &amp; voter education and election observation, political parties and parliaments dealing with electoral reforms, media, security forces and legal institutions confronted with electoral dispute resolution.  &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />ECES holds the Vice Presidency of the European Partnership for Democracy (EPD) and coordinates the implementation a joint strategy devised with the partners of EPD called \"A European Response to Electoral Cycles Support\".

The European Union and its Member States are the largest donors of ECES, however we have also signed contracts and partnered with many other organisations for implementing our activites.","acronym":"ECES","interests":"Development, Education, External Relations, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, Information Society","euInitiatives":"Building upon donors' evaluations of the electoral support programmes of the last 10 years, ECES focuses on the promotion of sustainable long-term capacity development throughout the electoral cycle, without detracting from the crucial activity of supporting electoral events and operations.&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />ECES specializes on effective handling of the very complex and delicate set of interactions among the Electoral Management Bodies, Multilateral and Bilateral Development Agencies, Governments, Civil Society Organizations, Political Parties and Providers of electoral material &amp; services. The proper management of this set of relationships requires specific skills that ECES has developed, going well beyond the pure technical advice. This is achieved by implementing the following:&#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Grounding electoral support more firmly within the political context/circumstances of the beneficiary state by using the political economy analysis approach; &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Promoting political dialogue as an integral part of the electoral assistance planning; &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Integrating electoral assistance projects with other activities that are carried out in the fields of democracy and development support &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Using strategic, operational and financial planning as a tool to ensure a phased approach within the cycle that donors, governments and electoral stakeholders could easily support; &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Increasing the synergies between national, regional and international election observation missions and the electoral assistance; &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Increasing the support to national election observation organisations for the development of appropriate and customised methodologies to implement long term observation or permanent observatory, focusing on the most sensitive steps of an electoral cycle; &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Emphasising on building and development of national and local capacities on the ground; &#xd;<br /> &#xd;<br />Increasing support to regional and national schools of electoral administration and to academic curricula related to electoral studies also via distance education and E-learning programmes using sustainable and cost effective communication technologies.","lastUp":"2018-01-29T12:42:56.635+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
