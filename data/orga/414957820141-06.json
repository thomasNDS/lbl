We are already today at the forefront of tomorrow’s standards for city data, services, and technology – and we work based on city needs with support from industry. OASC is driven by implementation and focused on open platforms and citizen engagement.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />OASC is growing rapidly and connects 100+ smart cities globally organised in national chapters. Together, we strive to establish the Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms (MIMs) needed to create a smart city market. MIMs are simple and transparent mechanisms, ready to use in any city, regardless of size or capacity. By implementing MIMs cities increase the speed and openness of innovation and development, whilst decreasing cost and inefficiency. In essence, MIMs allow cities to engage in global digital transformation.","acronym":"OASC","interests":"Agriculture, Banking and financial services, Borders and Security, Budget, Business and Industry, Climate Action, Communication, Competition, Consumers, Culture, Culture and media, Customs, Digital economy and society, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Energy, Enlargement, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, Foreign and Security Policy and Defence, General and Institutional Affairs, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Public Health, Regional Policy, Research and innovation, Single market, Sport, Taxation, Trade, Trans-European Networks, Transport, Youth","euInitiatives":"- Digital Single Market.&#xd;<br />- Standardisation.&#xd;<br />- European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities.&#xd;<br />- Urban Agenda.&#xd;<br />- Digital entrepreneurship.&#xd;<br />- Digital Europe Pogramme&#xd;<br />- Horizon Europe","lastUp":"2018-10-05T14:31:34.407+02:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":0,"costRange":"","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
