Driven by the Sustainable Development Goals, we are dedicated to a society in which all people are free to pursue their own sustainable development and no one is left behind. This commitment to equity directs us to focus on gender and youth.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We apply practical know-how to support people living in poverty. By connecting our global expertise with our extensive and longstanding in-country experiences, we help realise locally owned solutions. And we do so in more than 25 countries worldwide.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />We are experts in agriculture, energy, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Our services include advice, brokering and stakeholder engagement, advocacy, fund management, results-based financing and delegated management.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Our projects directly benefit millions of people. At the same time, our projects also drive systems change – strengthening institutions and kick-starting markets to help many more people work their way out of poverty, well beyond the scope of projects.","acronym":"SNV","interests":"Agriculture and Rural Development, Budget, Climate Action, Energy, Environment, External Relations, Food Safety, International co-operation and development, Maritime affairs and fisheries, Youth","euInitiatives":"EU policies and funding programs in the following three sectors: 1.
