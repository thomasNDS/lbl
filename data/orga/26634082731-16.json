IDDC believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide EU lobbying transparency. When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of IDDC, carry out such activities.&#xd;<br />Our registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU.","acronym":"IDDC","interests":"Employment and Social Affairs, External Relations, Humanitarian aid and civil protection, International co-operation and development, Justice and Fundamental Rights","euInitiatives":"Agenda 2030 questions at all levels (EP, EC, Council, EEAS) including the Multi-Stakeholder Platform (MSP)&#xd;<br />CRPD Implementation: follow-up &#xd;<br />CRPD Implementation: actions undertaken by the EU&#xd;<br />Financing for Development questions&#xd;<br />Human Rights issues in EU development cooperation&#xd;<br />Human Rights Action Plan&#xd;<br />Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF)&#xd;<br />Post-Cotonou negotiations&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />European Parliamentary Elections 2019&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Humanitarian Aid (Sendai and the Charter on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action)","lastUp":"2019-02-21T10:57:30.660+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"50000-99999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
