Memebr in Fertility Europe and the chair is an Exco member of it.&#xd;<br />CHEN founded in 1998, after our two children were born. &#xd;<br />Statistics show that there are about 160,000 couples with fertility problems in Israel (about 10 percent). In Israel, socio-cultural standards encourage every one to have children. “CHEN” was named after my late fathern. CHEN is based on voluntary manpower only. Currently there are 25 activists on the board and the executive team . 4700 couples are currently members of the association. We are fully voluntary.&#xd;<br />Our main activities are: &#xd;<br />•\tSupport at a personal level - Provided by a “hot line” that helps people by listening to their problems, providing them with encouragement, information, advice and moral support, and by talking to people with a 1st hand understanding of their situation. Also, support groups for patients and for their families.&#xd;<br />•\tFertility tourism to Israel – International assistance providing fertility treatments and touring of Israel.  We are currently promoting a project that encourages couples from all over the world to come to Israel for their IVF treatments as well as for a visit to the holy land of Israel. It’s cheaper, and our local, highly professional medical doctors and facilities provide success rates that are second to none.&#xd;<br />•\tHealth Service Providers &amp; Government - We help our members to cope with official Health Service Providers, that sometimes do not supply the needed treatments and medications that are covered by the National Health Bill. We are campaigning so the government will update the National Health Bill, to include new medications &amp; treatments.&#xd;<br />•\tLegislative – The new law was completed beginning of June 2010 . The Knessett vote the second and third vote for it. &#xd;<br />There is hope for 5,000 women waiting for an egg donation and the waiting time is between 6-12 months. The law will allow every woman that wants to donate eggs to do so. &#xd;<br />•\tNow we started a new law – embryos donation.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tBooks for Children – A tool for parents to tell their children how they were conceived, egg donation, sperm donation or surrogacy. A cooperation between MAIA association from France and CHEN association from Israel.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tSupport groups - we organize support groups for patients and their families and lectures all over Israel including in “Rahat”, a Bedouin city in the Negev.&#xd;<br />Cooking Workshop – In order to create a support group and overcome the shame of being infertile, we establish a cooking workshop to assist the couples to network with other couples.&#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />•\tPatient-to-patient net – this is a personal support net.
