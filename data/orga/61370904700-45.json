MEMBERS AND COVERAGE - Ceemet Members are national employer organisations, almost universally with a legal social partner mandate from metal, engineering and technology-based industries in 22 countries. Ceemet members are responsible for representing the social policy and industrial relations' interests of the metal companies in the country concerned, and, where so existing, for the conclusion of&#xd;<br />the collective agreements in the metal industry. Ceemet has the Australian Industry Group (Ai Group) as an associated Member. Ceemet also has contacts with cross-industry employers’ organisations in countries where no&#xd;<br />employer organisation of the metal, engineering and technology-based industries exist and here in particular in the new EU Member&#xd;<br />States, such as SP of the Czech Republic, MGYOSZ of Hungary, PKPP and KPP of Poland. The member organisations of Ceement&#xd;<br />cover -in principle- the entire range of sectors of the manufacturing industries, including &#xd;<br />• Basic Metals &#xd;<br />• Fabricated Metal Goods &#xd;<br />•Mechanical Engineering &#xd;<br />• Electrical and Electronical Industry&#xd;<br />• ICT Industries&#xd;<br />• Medical, precision and optical instruments, watches&#xd;<br />etc. &#xd;<br />• Transportation Means (automobile, ship, aircraft) &#xd;<br />• Instrument Engineering. &#xd;<br />&#xd;<br />Some national member organisations also cover the&#xd;<br />metal producing industries (iron and steel) or parts of it foundries. Altogether, the Ceemet Members represent about 200,000 member companies employing  35 million workers. The objectives as laid down in the statutes of Ceemet are “to promote the exchange of information among its members on all social issues which directly affect interests of these industries. It is also to facilitate&#xd;<br />concerted views and the formulation of statements on matters of common interest. In achieving these purposes the Association may&#xd;<br />make such representation to international organisations as is required.\" Ceemet activities and tasks are based on two pillars: - the&#xd;<br />exchange and structural documentation of national information on industrial relations, labour law or training matters in the metal and&#xd;<br />electrical industry - the follow-up of European matters, including lobbying on dossiers of particular interest to our industry. Ceemet&#xd;<br />follows the wide spectrum of social policy affairs via different Groups and Committees which meet regularly and deal with matters on - \"Industrial and Employee Relations\", - \"European Union\" - covering labour law and social protection - \"Education, Training and Employability\" - \"Health and Safety\" and - \"Socio-Economic Trends\". In January 2010 Ceemet and the EMF (European Metalworkers Federation) have set up a sectoral social dialogue committee covering the metal, engineering and technology-based industries - this committee was set up with the approval and recognition of the European Commission. Occasionally, Ceemet activities also address manufacturing specific issues at global level, in particular at ILO and and IOE level. Ceemet nearly entirely&#xd;<br />financed through membership contributions from its national member organisations.","acronym":"Ceemet","interests":"Budget, Business and Industry, Competition, Economy, finance and the euro, Education and training, Employment and Social Affairs, Institutional affairs, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Research and innovation, Single market, Youth","euInitiatives":"Ceemet's main focus lies with initiatives in the area of:&#xd;<br />a. labour market surveillance and labour law at national and European level, b. employment and social policy, including social protection, c. education and employability, d. health and safety at the workplace, e. national and European level industrial relations.&#xd;<br />Some recent related initiatives comprise the carrying out of an international Ceemet study on flexible forms of employment in the MET industry (2015), an international study on industrial relations and wage determination in the MET industry (2014), publishing a manifesto on industry EU policy priorities (industrial competitiveness for a social Europe)(2014) and organising a debate on this in the EP as well as the organisation of European Forums for Manufacturing, bringing together MEPs and Commission officials with representatives from national Ceemet members including practitioners from company level.&#xd;<br />Ceemet is the sole authoritative source of information on the current state of labour law in its representative sector, publishing its annual detailed summary of labour and employment law including the latest legal requirements resulting from its members' collective agreements.","lastUp":"2019-02-19T11:08:29.535+01:00","customers":"","costAbsolu":"","costRange":"100000-199999","turnoverAbsolu":0,"turnoverRange":""}
