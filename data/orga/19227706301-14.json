Its membership has broadened to include most oil companies operating in Europe. The scope of Concawe’s activities has gradually expanded in line with the development of societal concerns over environmental, health and safety issues. These now cover areas such as fuels quality and emissions, air quality, water quality, soil contamination, waste, occupational health and safety, petroleum product stewardship and cross-country pipeline performance. &#xd;<br />Concawe's mission is: &#xd;<br />To conduct research to provide impartial scientific information in order to:&#xd;<br />• Improve scientific understanding of the environmental, health, safety and economic performance aspects of both petroleum refining and the distribution and sustainable use of refined products.&#xd;<br />• Assist the development of technically feasible and cost effective policies and legislation by EU institutions and Member States.&#xd;<br />• Allow informed decision making and cost effective legislative compliance by Association members.","acronym":"Concawe","interests":"Climate Action, Energy, Environment, Public Health, Research and Technology, Transport","euInitiatives":"Various REACH related groups, at ECHA &amp; the Commission (e.g. REACH Directors' Contact Group).
